 Modern amphibians ( frogs , salamanders , and caecilians ) are classified in Lissamphibia . <unk> appear to have arisen in the Permian . Molecular clock estimates place the first <unk> in the Late Carboniferous , but the first member of Batrachia ( frogs and salamanders , but not caecilians ) is estimated to have appeared in the Middle Permian using the same technique . Using fossil evidence , there are three main theories for the origin of modern amphibians .
 One is that they evolved from <unk> <unk> . Another is that they evolved from <unk> , most likely the <unk> . A third hypothesis is that caecilians descended from <unk> and frogs and salamanders evolved from <unk> .
 Recently , the theory that <unk> were the ancestors of all lissamphibians has gained wide support . The skull morphology of some small <unk> has been compared to those of modern frogs and salamanders , but the presence of bicuspid , pedicellate teeth in small , paedomorphic or immature <unk> has been cited as the most convincing argument in favor of the temnospondyl origin of lissamphibians . Seen in lissamphibians and many <unk> <unk> , pedicellate teeth have calcified tips and bases . During the development of most tetrapods , teeth begin to <unk> at their tips . <unk> normally proceeds downward to the base of the tooth , but calcification from the tip stops abruptly in pedicellate teeth . <unk> resumes at the base , leaving an area in the center of the tooth <unk> . This pattern is seen in living amphibians and fossils .
 The <unk> family <unk> is thought to be most closely related to Lissamphibia . In 2008 , an <unk> called <unk> <unk> was named from Texas and was nicknamed the " <unk> " for its frog @-@ like head and salamander @-@ like body . It was thought to be the most closely related temnospondyl to lissamphibians and was placed as the sister taxon of the group in a phylogenetic analysis . Another species of <unk> called <unk> annectens is now thought to be even more closely related to lissamphibians . Unlike <unk> , <unk> was known since 1969 , and the presence of pedicellate teeth in its jaws has led some paleontologists to conclude soon after its naming that it was a relative of modern amphibians . It was first described as a " <unk> " , and the specific name annectens means " connecting " in reference to its inferred transitional position between <unk> and lissamphibians . The structure of its tympanum , a disk @-@ like membrane that functions like an ear drum , is similar to that of frogs and has also been used as evidence for a close relationship . Other features including the shape of the palate and the back of the skull , the short ribs , and the smooth skull surface also point to it being a closer relative of lissamphibians than is <unk> . Below is a cladogram modified from <unk> and Bolt ( 2010 ) showing the relationships of <unk> , <unk> , and Lissamphibia :
