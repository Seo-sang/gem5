 Outside of Warren Corners , the route heads across rural areas along the Cambria – Lockport town line . It soon enters the small hamlet of Hickory Corners , where the road passes under Lower Mountain Road ( CR 902 ) . Access to the highway is made by way of Town Line Road Spur ( CR 114 ) , a connector leading to Lower Mountain Road . NY 93 continues southward along the town line , changing names to Junction Road at an intersection with Upper Mountain Road ( CR 5 ) west of the city of Lockport . From here , the route crosses over CSX Transportation 's Lockport Subdivision rail line at the hamlet of Lockport Junction before intersecting with NY 31 ( Saunders Settlement Road ) and NY 270 ( Campbell Boulevard ) just south of the community . NY 270 begins straight ahead to the south while NY 93 turns northeast onto Saunders Settlement Road , beginning a concurrency with NY 31 .
 Now fully in the town of Lockport , NY 31 and NY 93 proceed northeast through an open area of the town as a four @-@ lane divided highway . The two routes continue to the western edge of the city of Lockport , where they intersect with Upper Mountain Road and the Lockport Bypass . The overlap ends here as NY 93 turns southeastward onto the two @-@ lane bypass . Along the bypass , NY 93 briefly enters the city limits as it runs past several industrial facilities and intersects with Hinman Road ( CR 903 ) just ahead of a bridge over the Erie Canal . Past the waterway , the bypass takes a more southerly course through an undeveloped part of the town of Lockport to a junction with Robinson Road ( CR 123 ) on the Lockport – Pendleton town line . The Lockport Bypass ends here , leaving NY 93 to turn eastward onto Robinson Road .
 The route initially serves a line of homes as it heads along Robinson Road ; however , it soon enters a commercial district surrounding the road 's intersection with NY 78 ( Transit Road ) . At this point , the Lockport – Pendleton town line turns south to follow NY 78 , leaving NY 93 fully within the town of Lockport as it runs eastward past another stretch of homes . Not far from NY 78 , NY 93 changes names to <unk> Road at an intersection with Beattie Avenue ( CR 14 ) and Raymond Road ( CR 85 ) . The junction also marks a shift in the road 's surroundings as the homes give way to open , rolling terrain . NY 93 continues eastward for several miles to the town of Royalton , where it meets Riddle Road ( CR 35 ) and Akron Road ( CR 142 ) at adjacent intersections just east of the town line .
