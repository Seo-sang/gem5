 <unk> includes both large trees and small acaulescent palms which occupy a number of different ecological niches . Dense stands of some of the larger species are conspicuous elements on the landscape , while smaller species are found in both in the forest understorey and in savannas .
 Disturbance has been implicated in the formation of vegetation dominated by large <unk> species . In seasonally dry Amazonian forests the density of large adult A. <unk> palms was correlated with canopy openness ; the species also dominates savannas formed by repeated forest fires in Trinidad and Tobago . <unk> speciosa forms pure stands in many parts of Brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared . Similarly , stands of A. <unk> in Bahia , Brazil ( which are cultivated for <unk> fibre ) are managed using fire â€” the seedlings survive cutting and burning , and are able to dominate burned forest patches .
 The fruit are dispersed by animals ; fruit which are not dispersed frequently suffer seed predation by <unk> beetles . Certain species of <unk> have been mentioned as examples of " anachronistic " species which are adapted for dispersal by now @-@ extinct Pleistocene megafauna . On <unk> Island , <unk> , in the Brazilian Amazon , <unk> <unk> fruit were consumed by tapirs , collared peccaries , deer and primates . Rodents , including agoutis , fed upon the fruit and , as the fruit availability declined , they fed on the seeds . Other dispersers of <unk> fruit include Crested <unk> which consume the fruit and disperse the seeds of A. <unk> in the Brazilian Pantanal .
