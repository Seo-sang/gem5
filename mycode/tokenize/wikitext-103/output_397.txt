 Nero was not expected to become Emperor because his maternal uncle , Caligula , had begun his reign at the age of 24 with enough time to produce his own heir . Nero 's mother , Agrippina , lost favour with Caligula and was exiled in 39 after her husband 's death . Caligula seized Nero 's inheritance and sent him to be brought up by his less wealthy aunt , Domitia <unk> , who was the mother of Valeria <unk> , Claudius 's third wife . Caligula , his wife <unk> and their infant daughter Julia Drusilla were murdered on 24 January 41 . These events led Claudius , Caligula 's uncle , to become emperor . Claudius allowed Agrippina to return from exile .
 Claudius had married twice before marrying Valeria <unk> . His previous marriages produced three children including a son , Drusus , who died at a young age . He had two children with <unk> â€“ Claudia Octavia ( born 40 ) and Britannicus ( born 41 ) . <unk> was executed by Claudius in the year 48 .
 In 49 AD , Claudius married a fourth time , to Nero 's mother Agrippina , despite her being his niece . To aid Claudius politically , young Nero was adopted in 50 and took the name Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus ( see adoption in Rome ) . Nero was older than his stepbrother Britannicus , and thus became heir to the throne .
 Nero was proclaimed an adult in 51 at the age of 14 . He was appointed proconsul , entered and first addressed the Senate , made joint public appearances with Claudius , and was featured in coinage . In 53 , he married his stepsister Claudia Octavia .
