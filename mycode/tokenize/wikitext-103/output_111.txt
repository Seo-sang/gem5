 Many <unk> are much larger than living amphibians , and superficially resemble crocodiles . Others are smaller and resemble salamanders . Most have broad , flat heads that are either blunt ( <unk> ) or elongated ( <unk> ) . The skulls are rounded or triangular in shape when viewed from above , and are usually covered in pits and ridges . The rugged surfaces of bones may have supported blood vessels , which could transfer carbon dioxide to the bones to neutralize acidic build up in the blood ( early semiaquatic tetrapods would have had difficulty expelling carbon dioxide from their bodies while on land , and these dermal bones may have been an early solution to the problem ) . Many <unk> also have canal @-@ like grooves in their skulls called sensory sulci . The sulci , which usually run around the nostrils and eye sockets , are part of a lateral line system used to detect vibrations in water . As semiaquatic animals , most <unk> have small limbs with four toes on each front foot and five on each hind foot . Terrestrial <unk> have larger , thicker limbs , and some even have claws . One unusual terrestrial temnospondyl , <unk> , has relatively long limbs for its body , and probably lived as an active runner able to chase prey .
 <unk> of most of the bones of <unk> are also seen in other early tetrapods , aside from a few bones in the skull , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , that have developed in some temnospondyl taxa . Most <unk> have tabular horns in the backs of their skulls , rounded projections of bone separated from the rest of the skull by indentations called otic notches ; in some <unk> , such as <unk> , they are pointed and very prominent . Among the most distinguishing features of <unk> are the <unk> vacuities , two large holes in the back of the palate . Another pair of holes , <unk> , are present in front of these vacuities , and connect the nasal passage with the mouth . <unk> often have teeth on their palates , as well as in their jaws . Some of these teeth are so large , they are referred to as tusks . In some <unk> , such as <unk> , tusks in the lower jaw pierce the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull .
 Very little is known of the soft tissue of <unk> . A block of sandstone , described in 2007 from the Early Carboniferous Mauch Chunk Formation of Pennsylvania , included impressions of the bodies of three <unk> . These impressions show , when alive , they had smooth skin , robust limbs with webbed feet , and a ridge of skin on their undersides . Trackways referable to small <unk> have also been found in Carboniferous and Permian rocks . The trackways , called <unk> , are usually found in strata deposited around freshwater environments , suggesting the animals had some ties to the water .
 Unlike modern amphibians , many <unk> are covered in small , closely packed scales . The undersides of most <unk> are covered in rows of large ventral plates . During early stages of development , they first have only small , rounded scales . Fossils show , as the animals grew , the scales on the undersides of their bodies developed into large , wide ventral plates . The plates overlap each other in a way that allows a wide range of flexibility . Later semiaquatic <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> , have no evidence of scales . They may have lost scales to make movement easier under water or to allow cutaneous respiration , the absorption of oxygen through the skin .
 Several groups of <unk> have large bony plates on their backs . One temnospondyl , <unk> , has armour @-@ like plating that covers both its back and underside . The temnospondyl <unk> also has extensive plating on its back . Most members of the family <unk> also have armor , although it only covers the midline of the back with two narrow rows of plates . Other <unk> , such as <unk> , have been found with small , disc @-@ like bony scutes that were in life probably embedded in the skin . All of these <unk> were adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle . Armor may have offered protection from predators in the case of <unk> . The scutes may have provided stability for the spine , as they would have limited flexibility and may have been connected by strong ligaments . <unk> such as <unk> and <unk> that may have been at least partly terrestrial also have long neural spines on top of their vertebrae that would have stabilized the spine . Bony scutes are also seen in <unk> , but unlike <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , these animals are thought to have been fully aquatic . <unk> may have inherited their armor from a terrestrial ancestor , as both <unk> and <unk> have been considered close relatives of the group .
 <unk> ' vertebrae are divided into several segments . In living tetrapods , the main body of the vertebra is a single piece of bone called the centrum , but in <unk> , this region was divided into a <unk> and <unk> . Two types of vertebrae are recognized in <unk> : <unk> and <unk> vertebrae . In <unk> vertebrae , the <unk> are large and wedge @-@ shaped , and the <unk> are relatively small blocks that fit between them . Both elements support a spine @-@ like neural arch , and well @-@ developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between vertebrae . The strong backbone and strong limbs of many <unk> <unk> allowed them to be partially , and in some cases fully , terrestrial . In <unk> vertebrae , the <unk> have been lost entirely , with the <unk> enlarged as the main body of the vertebrae . This weaker type of backbone indicates the <unk> <unk> spent more time in water .
