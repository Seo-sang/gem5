 <unk> has been placed in the subfamily Arecoideae , the tribe <unk> and the subtribe <unk> , together with the genera <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Cocos , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Within this subtribe , <unk> has been found to be a monophyletic group , and sister to the clade containing <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
 Disagreement exists as to whether <unk> should be considered a single genus , or a group of related genera . In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas , Andrew Henderson , Gloria Galeano and Rodrigo Bernal combined all the species in the subtribe <unk> ( as it was then defined ) into a single genus , <unk> . In his 1999 Taxonomic Treatment of Palm Subtribe <unk> , American botanist Sidney F. Glassman divided the group into five genera — a more narrowly defined <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . <unk> <unk> and John Dransfield recognised a single genus in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms , and Jean @-@ Christophe <unk> continued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus .
 The multi @-@ genus approach is based solely on the structure of the male flowers ; no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another . Four of the genera — <unk> ( in a narrow sense ) , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> — correspond to four different types of male flowers found within the genus . However , a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types , including A. <unk> ( which Glassman placed in its own genus , <unk> ) and this has been used as an argument for the single @-@ genus approach . In addition , there are several hybrids between species that would be considered different genera under Glassman 's five @-@ genus system , which has also been used as an argument for placing them in a single genus . In 2009 Alan <unk> and colleagues published a molecular phylogeny of the subtribe which found that some species placed in <unk> were actually more closely related to species placed in <unk> than they were to other members of that genus ( if the five @-@ genus approach was used ) , while A. <unk> , placed in <unk> by Glassman , was actually a sister to both <unk> and <unk> .
