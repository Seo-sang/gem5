 The image impedances of the section are given by
 <formula>
 and
 <formula>
 Given that the filter does not contain any resistive elements , the image impedance in the pass band of the filter is purely real and in the stop band it is purely imaginary . For example , for the pictured low @-@ pass half @-@ section ,
 <formula>
 The transition occurs at a cut @-@ off frequency given by
 <formula>
 Below this frequency , the image impedance is real ,
 <formula>
 Above the cut @-@ off frequency the image impedance is imaginary ,
 <formula>
