 Known as the " Floating Trojan Horse of Gibraltar " , Decima <unk> MAS , an Italian commando frogman unit created during the Fascist government , engaged in numerous attacks against the harbour at Gibraltar .
 Gibraltar was a very tempting target for the Italians , who saw it as a refuge for British warships and allied merchant shipping . The Italian frogmen originally used a Spanish villa ( Villa Carmela ) located two miles ( 3 km ) from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named Conchita <unk> . Their base was shifted later to the Italian tanker SS <unk> , interned in Algeciras .
