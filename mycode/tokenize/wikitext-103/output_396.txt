 Lucius Domitius <unk> , Nero , was born on 15 December 37 in <unk> ( modern Anzio and Nettuno ) , near Rome . He was the only son of Gnaeus Domitius <unk> and Agrippina the Younger , sister of Emperor Caligula .
 Nero 's father , Gnaeus , was the son of Lucius Domitius <unk> ( consul 16 BC ) and Antonia Major . Gnaeus was thus the grandson of Gnaeus Domitius <unk> ( consul 32 BC ) and probably <unk> <unk> on his father 's side , and the grandson of Mark Antony and Octavia Minor on his mother 's side . Thus , Nero had as his paternal grandmother Antonia Major , and also claimed more remote descent from Antonia Minor as a great @-@ grandson â€” later grandson after Claudius adopted him .
 Through Octavia , Nero was the great @-@ nephew of Caesar Augustus . Nero 's father had been employed as a praetor and was a member of Caligula 's staff when the latter travelled to the East ( some apparently think Suetonius refers to Augustus 's adopted son Gaius Caesar here , but this is not likely ) .
 Nero 's father was described by Suetonius as a murderer and a cheat who was charged by Emperor Tiberius with treason , adultery and incest . Tiberius died , allowing him to escape these charges . Nero 's father died of edema ( " dropsy " ) in 39 when Nero was two .
 Nero 's mother was Agrippina the Younger , a great @-@ granddaughter of Caesar Augustus and his wife Scribonia through their daughter Julia the Elder and her husband Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa . Agrippina 's father , Germanicus , was a grandson of Augustus 's wife , Livia , on one side and to Mark Antony and Octavia on the other . Germanicus ' mother Antonia Minor , was a daughter of Octavia Minor and Mark Antony . Octavia was Augustus ' elder sister . Germanicus was also the adopted son of Tiberius . Agrippina poisoned her second husband <unk> Crispus , so many ancient historians also accuse her of murdering her third husband , the emperor Claudius .
