 During the Late Permian , increasing aridity and the diversification of reptiles contributed into a decline in terrestrial <unk> , but semiaquatic and fully aquatic <unk> continued to flourish , including the large <unk> of Eastern Europe . Other <unk> , such as <unk> , developed long snouts and a close similarity to crocodiles , although they lacked the armor characteristic of the latter group . These <unk> included the largest known amphibian , the 9 @-@ m @-@ long <unk> of Brazil .
