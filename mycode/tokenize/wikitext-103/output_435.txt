 Manila has six legislative districts that serve as the constituencies for the election of the city 's representatives to the lower house of the Congress of the Philippines and of the regular members to the Sangguniang <unk> ( SP ; City Council ) . Each district elects one representative to the House of Representatives and six SP members to the council . The city , along with the rest of the nation , elects 12 senators as one at @-@ large district .
 Manila is politically divided into 896 barangays , the smallest unit of local government in the Philippines . Each barangay has its own chairperson and councilors . For administrative convenience , all the barangays in Manila are grouped into 100 zones . These zones have no form of local government .
 The 1st District ( 2015 population : 415 @,@ 906 ) is Manila 's ( and the country 's ) most densely populated congressional district . It covers the western portion of Tondo that lies along Manila Bay .
 The 2nd District ( 2015 population : 215 @,@ 457 ) covers the eastern inland portion of Tondo , a neighborhood or sub @-@ district known as <unk> .
 The 3rd District ( 2015 population : 197 @,@ 242 ) covers Binondo , Quiapo , San Nicolas and Santa Cruz .

 Manila has the most number of barangays of any city or municipality in the Philippines . Attempts at reducing its number have not prospered despite local legislation — Ordinance <unk> , passed on 23 April 1996 — reducing the number from 897 to 150 by merging existing barangays , because of the failure to hold a plebiscite .
