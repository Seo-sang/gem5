 On October 8 , 2005 , Lesnar won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship on his debut match in a three @-@ way match with Kazuyuki Fujita and Masahiro Chono at a New Japan Pro Wrestling ( NJPW ) show in the Tokyo Dome . Lesnar is one of the few American wrestlers to have held this title . He won the match by pinning Masahiro Chono after an F @-@ 5 , which he had renamed the Verdict since WWE owns the trademark on the F @-@ 5 name . After the match , Lesnar stated that this name was referring to his lawsuit against WWE .
 On December 6 , WWE filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent Lesnar from continuing to work with NJPW , but the court did not grant it . Following that , he had two non @-@ title victories against Manabu Nakanishi and Yuji Nagata . Lesnar successfully defended his championship on January 4 , 2006 , against former champion Shinsuke Nakamura . On January 13 , WWE once again filed an injunction against Lesnar to stop him from defending the IWGP Heavyweight Championship which was also not enforced as he went on to retain his championship against former Sumo Wrestling Grand Champion Akebono on March 19 , at the Sumo Hall . Lesnar had another successful title defense against Giant Bernard on May 3 , 2006 . This was the first American vs. American title match in NJPW since Vader vs. Stan Hansen in 1990 .
 On July 15 , 2006 , New Japan Pro Wrestling announced Lesnar would not return to defend the IWGP Heavyweight Championship due to " visa issues " and had been stripped of the title . A tournament was held on July 16 to determine the new champion which was won by Hiroshi Tanahashi . Lesnar continued to possess the physical IWGP Championship belt until late June 2007 .
 Approximately one year later on June 29 , 2007 , Lesnar defended his IWGP Heavyweight Championship against TNA World Heavyweight Champion Kurt Angle in a champion versus champion match . Inoki Genome Federation promoter Antonio Inoki had stated Lesnar was the " proper " IWGP Heavyweight Champion as he was not defeated for the title . Angle would defeat Lesnar by forcing him to tap out to the Angle lock to win the IWGP Heavyweight Championship as recognized by IGF and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) . This was Lesnar 's last match as a professional wrestler until 2012 , when he re @-@ signed with WWE .
