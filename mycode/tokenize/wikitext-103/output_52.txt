 On the southern @-@ most flank of the 9th Infantry river line , just above the junction of the Nam River with the Naktong , A Company of the 1st Battalion was dug in on a long finger ridge paralleling the Naktong that terminates in Hill 94 at the <unk> ferry site . The river road from Namji @-@ ri running west along the Naktong passes the southern tip of this ridge and crosses to the west side of the river at the ferry . A small village called Agok lay at the base of Hill 94 and 300 yards ( 270 m ) from the river . A patrol of tanks and armored vehicles , together with two infantry squads of A Company , 9th Infantry , held a roadblock near the ferry and close to Agok . On the evening of August 31 , A Company moved from its ridge positions overlooking Agok and the river to new positions along the river below the ridge line .
 That evening Sergeant Ernest R. Kouma led the patrol of two M26 Pershing tanks and two M19 Gun Motor Carriages in Agok . Kouma placed his patrol on the west side of Agok near the <unk> ferry . At 20 : 00 a heavy fog covered the river , and at 22 : 00 mortar shells began falling on the American @-@ held side of the river . By 22 : 15 this strike intensified and North Korean mortar preparation struck A Company 's positions . American mortars and artillery began firing counterbattery . Some of the A Company men reported they heard noises on the opposite side of the river and splashes in the water .
 At 22 : 30 the fog lifted and Kouma saw that a North Korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river directly in front of his position . Kouma 's four vehicles attacked this structure , and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed , and the <unk> boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk . At 23 : 00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks . This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise .
 Kouma 's patrol was then ambushed by a group of North Koreans dressed in US military uniforms . Kouma was wounded and the other three vehicles had to withdraw , but he held the Agok site until 07 : 30 the next morning with his single tank . In the attack against A Company , the North Koreans hit the 1st Platoon , which was near Agok , but they did not find the 2nd Platoon northward .
 The NK 9th Division 's infantry crossing of the Naktong and attack on its east side near midnight quickly overran the positions of C Company , north of A Company . There the North Koreans assaulted in force , signaled by green flares and blowing of whistles . The company held its positions only a short time and then attempted to escape . Many of the men moved south , a few of them coming into A Company 's ridge line positions near Agok during the night . Most of C Company moved all the way to the 25th Division positions south of the Naktong . On September 1 that division reported that 110 men of C Company had come into its lines .
