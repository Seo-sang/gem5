 Temnospondyli ( from Greek <unk> ( <unk> , " to cut " ) and <unk> ( <unk> , " vertebra " ) ) is a diverse subclass of extinct small to giant tetrapods — often considered primitive amphibians — that flourished worldwide during the Carboniferous , Permian , and Triassic periods . A few species continued into the Cretaceous . Fossils have been found on every continent . During about 210 million years of evolutionary history , they adapted to a wide range of habitats , including fresh water , terrestrial , and even coastal marine environments . Their life history is well understood , with fossils known from the larval stage , metamorphosis , and maturity . Most <unk> were semiaquatic , although some were almost fully terrestrial , returning to the water only to breed . These <unk> were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land . Although <unk> are considered amphibians , many had characteristics , such as scales , claws , and armour @-@ like bony plates , that distinguish them from modern amphibians .
 <unk> have been known since the early 19th century , and were initially thought to be reptiles . They were described at various times as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , although these names are now rarely used . Animals now grouped in Temnospondyli were spread out among several amphibian groups until the early 20th century , when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based on the structure of their vertebrae . Temnospondyli means " cut vertebrae " , as each vertebra is divided into several parts .
 Experts disagree over whether <unk> were ancestral to modern amphibians ( frogs , salamanders , and caecilians ) , or whether the whole group died out without leaving any descendants . Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of <unk> , another group of early tetrapods called <unk> , or even as descendants of both groups ( with caecilians evolving from <unk> and frogs and salamanders evolving from <unk> ) . Recent studies place a family of <unk> called the <unk> as the closest relatives of modern amphibians . Similarities in teeth , skulls , and hearing structures link the two groups .
