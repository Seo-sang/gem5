 A number of design faults of the Tetrarch were revealed through its operational use . Its size limited the possible crew to three , a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret , resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively . The gunner or commander , in addition to his own duties , had to act as loader for the 2 pounder , which caused delays in combat . A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank , controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible .
 Problems were also found with the Littlejohn adaptor fitted to the 2 @-@ pounder to increase its range and penetration power ; after they had been fitted the adapters could not be removed , and could only fire specially designed armour @-@ piercing rounds , which took time to manufacture .
 The War Office also considered the Tetrarch 's cooling system faulty , making the tank unsuitable for service in hotter climates , such as the Middle East and North Africa .
