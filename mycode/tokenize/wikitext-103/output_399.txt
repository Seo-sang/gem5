 Over time , Nero became progressively more powerful , freeing himself of his advisers and eliminating rivals to the throne . In 55 , he removed Marcus Antonius Pallas , an ally of Agrippina , from his position in the treasury . Pallas , along with <unk> , was accused of conspiring against the Emperor to bring Faustus Sulla to the throne . Seneca was accused of having relations with Agrippina and embezzlement . Seneca succeeded in having himself , Pallas and <unk> acquitted . According to Cassius Dio , at this time , Seneca and <unk> reduced their role in governing from careful management to mere moderation of Nero .
 In 58 , Nero became romantically involved with Poppaea Sabina , the wife of his friend and future emperor Otho . Reportedly because a marriage to Poppaea and a divorce from Octavia did not seem politically feasible with Agrippina alive , Nero ordered the murder of his mother in 59 . A number of modern historians find this an unlikely motive as Nero did not marry Poppaea until 62 .
 Additionally , according to Suetonius , Poppaea did not divorce her husband until after Agrippina 's death , making it unlikely that the already married Poppaea would be pressing Nero for marriage . Some modern historians theorize that Nero 's execution of Agrippina was prompted by her plotting to set <unk> Plautus on the throne . According to Suetonius , Nero tried to kill his mother through a shipwreck planned by his freedman tutor Anicetus . Instead , it took the life of Agrippina 's friend , <unk> Polla . When Agrippina survived , he had her executed by Anicetus and framed it as a suicide . The incident is also recorded by Tacitus .
 In 62 , Nero 's adviser , <unk> , died . Additionally , Seneca was again faced with embezzlement charges . Seneca asked Nero for permission to retire from public affairs . Nero divorced and banished Octavia on grounds of infertility , leaving him free to marry the pregnant Poppaea . After public protests , Nero was forced to allow Octavia to return from exile , but she was executed shortly after her return .
 Nero also was reported to have kicked Poppaea to death in 65 before she could have his second child . However , modern historians , noting Suetonius , Tacitus and Cassius Dio 's possible bias against Nero and the likelihood that they did not have eyewitness accounts of private events , postulate that Poppaea may have died because of complications of miscarriage or childbirth .
 Accusations of treason being plotted against Nero and the Senate first appeared in 62 . The Senate ruled that <unk> , a praetor , should be put to death for speaking ill of Nero at a party . Later , Nero ordered the exile of Fabricius <unk> who slandered the Senate in a book . Tacitus writes that the roots of the conspiracy led by Gaius Calpurnius Piso began in this year . To consolidate power , Nero executed a number of people in 62 and 63 including his rivals Pallas , <unk> Plautus and Faustus Sulla . According to Suetonius , Nero " showed neither discrimination nor moderation in putting to death <unk> he pleased " during this period .
 Nero 's consolidation of power also included a slow usurping of authority from the Senate . In 54 , Nero promised to give the Senate powers equivalent to those under Republican rule . By 65 , senators complained that they had no power left and this led to the Pisonian conspiracy .
