 Temnospondyli was named by German palaeontologist Karl Alfred von Zittel in his second edition of Handbuch der <unk> , published in 1888 . <unk> remains were known since the early part of the 19th century , however . The earliest described temnospondyl was Mastodonsaurus , named by Georg Friedrich Jaeger in 1828 . Jaeger named Mastodonsaurus from a single tooth , and considered it a reptile . Mastodonsaurus means " breast tooth lizard " after the nipple @-@ like shape of the tip of the tooth .
 The naming of these first specimens was disputed , however . Leopold Fitzinger named the animal <unk> in 1837 . In 1841 , English palaeontologist Richard Owen referred to the genus as Labyrinthodon to describe its highly folded or labyrinthine teeth . Owen thought the name Mastodonsaurus " ought not to be retained , because it recalls unavoidably the idea of the mammalian genus Mastodon , or else a <unk> form of the tooth ... and because the second element of the word , saurus , indicates a false affinity , the remains belonging , not to the Saurian , but to the <unk> order of Reptiles . " Owen recognized the animal was not a " saurian " reptile , yet he also referred Jaeger 's <unk> to the genus . Although the two genera both have similarly sized conical teeth , <unk> was later found to be a crocodile @-@ like reptile . Additional material , including skulls , firmly placed Labyrinthodon as an amphibian . Jaeger also named <unk> giganteus in 1828 , basing it on partial occiput , or back portion of the skull . In 1833 , he described a complete skull of S. giganteus that had the same teeth as his Mastodonsaurus , making it the first known complete skull of a temnospondyl . Because Mastodonsaurus was named first , it has precedence over the other names as a senior subjective synonym . <unk> is still used as the name of an unrelated <unk> temnospondyl .
 Mastodonsaurus and other similar animals were referred to as <unk> , named like Labyrinthodon for teeth that were highly folded in cross section . Owen 's " Labyrinthodon <unk> " was later found at Guy 's Cliffe , England by paleontologist William Buckland . Other specimens were found in the red sandstone of Warwickshire . As more fossils were uncovered in England , Owen depicted these <unk> as the " highest " form of <unk> and compared them to crocodiles , which he considered the highest form of reptiles . He also noted the large <unk> of the Keuper ( a unit of rocks that dates to the Late Triassic ) were younger than more advanced reptiles in the <unk> and <unk> , which are Late Permian in age . Owen used these fossils to counter the notion that reptiles evolved from a sequential progression from early amphibians ( what he called " metamorphosed fishes " ) .
 In addition to Mastodonsaurus , some of the earliest named genera included <unk> and <unk> in 1842 , <unk> in 1848 , <unk> in 1849 , <unk> and <unk> in 1853 , <unk> in 1858 , and <unk> in 1859 . <unk> is now placed as an early tetrapod outside Temnospondyli , and <unk> is now considered a <unk> reptile .
 Later in the 19th century , <unk> were classified as various members of <unk> , a name coined by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1868 . Cope placed <unk> in the class Batrachia , the name then used for Amphibia . <unk> means " roof @-@ headed " in Greek , a reference to the wide , flat heads of <unk> and other early tetrapods . During this time , palaeontologists considered <unk> to be amphibians because they possessed three main features : gill arches in juvenile skeletons , indicating they were amphibious for at least the first part of their lives ; ribs that do not connect at the underside of the rib cage ; and deep pits in the skull that were interpreted as space for mucous glands .
 Several suborders of <unk> were recognized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Animals now regarded as <unk> were primarily <unk> , but some were classified in the <unk> . <unk> were small @-@ bodied and had simple conical teeth , while <unk> were larger and had complex , folded dentin and enamel in their teeth . <unk> included only a few forms , such as <unk> from Europe and <unk> from North America , that had poorly developed bones , external gills , and no ribs . Some skeletons of <unk> were later found with long ribs , prompting its reassignment to <unk> ( although more detailed studies found it to be a temnospondyl ) . Soft tissue , such as scales and external gills , were found in many well @-@ preserved <unk> fossils from Germany . In the early 20th century , <unk> would be recognized as larval forms of <unk> lacking many of the typical features that define the group , and is no longer recognized as a distinct group .
 Other animals that would later be classified as <unk> were placed in a group called <unk> , characterized by plate @-@ like skull bones , small limbs , fish @-@ like scales , and branchial arches . Unlike <unk> , they did not have parietal <unk> , small holes in their skulls behind their eye sockets . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> were placed in this group and were considered to be the most primitive members of <unk> . Their <unk> vertebrae , notochord , and lack of occipital condyles ( which attached the head to the neck ) were features that were also shared with fishes . Thus , they were considered a link between early fishes and more advanced forms such as <unk> .
 Another group called <unk> was named by Cope in 1868 . Cope classified <unk> as a subgroup of Labyrinthodontia , placing many small , amphibian @-@ like animals within it . Among them were <unk> , once placed in <unk> . <unk> was later placed as a <unk> with other <unk> , but confusion existed for many years over the classification of small amphibians .
 By the end of the 19th century , most of what are today regarded as <unk> were placed in the suborder <unk> . American paleontologist Ermine Cowles Case called it <unk> vera or " true <unk> " . The names <unk> and Labyrinthodontia were used interchangeably to refer to the order in which it belonged . The <unk> suborders <unk> and <unk> , both of which contain <unk> , were distinct from <unk> . Within <unk> were the groups <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . Members of <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> , had <unk> vertebrae with enlarged <unk> that displaced the <unk> . <unk> , such as Mastodonsaurus , <unk> , and <unk> , had lost their <unk> , and the <unk> made up the entire body of the vertebrae . <unk> had <unk> and <unk> that were of equal size . <unk> are now identified as <unk> distantly related to <unk> .
 In 1888 , von Zittel divided <unk> among three taxa : Lepospondyli , Temnospondyli , and <unk> . He placed <unk> in Lepospondyli , a group which he characterized as having simple , spool @-@ shaped vertebral centra . Temnospondyli included forms with the centra divided into <unk> and <unk> . All members of <unk> had amphicoelous centra composed only of the <unk> . Cope objected to von Zittel 's classification , considering the vertebrae of <unk> and <unk> indistinguishable because each had a simple spool shape . He continued to use <unk> and <unk> ( which he alternatively referred to as <unk> ) to distinguish animals based on the absence or presence of occipital condyles .
 Temnospondyli became a commonly used name at the turn of the century . Paleontologists included both <unk> and <unk> in the group . Cope 's <unk> and <unk> fell out of use . In 1919 , British paleontologist D. M. S. Watson proposed that the evolutionary history of these large amphibians could be seen through changes in their vertebrae . <unk> forms in the Carboniferous graded into <unk> forms in the Permian , and finally into <unk> in the Triassic . More importantly , Watson began using the term Labyrinthodontia to refer to these groups . The name Temnospondyli was rarely used in the decades that followed . Swedish paleontologist Gunnar <unk> @-@ <unk> removed <unk> from the group , narrowing its scope to <unk> and <unk> . His classification of <unk> was based heavily on characteristics of the skull rather than the vertebrae .
 American paleontologist Alfred Romer brought the name Temnospondyli back into use in the later 20th century . <unk> @-@ <unk> used the name Labyrinthodontia in a strict sense ( sensu stricto ) to refer to <unk> and <unk> , excluding <unk> . Romer agreed with this classification , but used the name Temnospondyli to avoid confusion with Labyrinthodontia in its wider sense ( sensu lato ) . Unlike modern temnospondyl classification , however , Romer included the primitive <unk> in the group .
