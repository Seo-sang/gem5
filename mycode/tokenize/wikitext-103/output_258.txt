 <unk> have been found to undergo rearrangement reactions via a radical mechanism when irradiated with UV light or in the presence of a single electron transfer reagent such as <unk> <unk> <unk> undergo ring expansions to the corresponding lactam . Interestingly , the migrating substituent is determined by a <unk> effect where the group trans to the lone pair on the nitrogen will always be the predominant migration product . In light of this effect , it is possible to take advantage of the chiral nitrogen due to high inversion barrier to direct the rearrangement . This phenomenon is demonstrated by observed <unk> in the rearrangements below . In the rearrangement on the left the thermodynamically unfavorable product is observed exclusively , while in the reaction on the right the product derived from the less stable radical intermediate is favored .
 <unk> takes advantage of this rearrangement as the key step in his synthesis of ( + ) <unk> , a natural medicine classified by the NIH as possibly effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and the sexual problems caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors .
 It is also notable that <unk> will thermally rearrange to <unk> . Cis @-@ trans selectivity of the resulting <unk> is poor , however , yields are good to excellent . It is thought that some <unk> <unk> over time through a <unk> intermediate .
