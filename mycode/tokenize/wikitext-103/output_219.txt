 On January 11 , the JTWC began monitoring the disturbance that would eventually develop into <unk> near the International Date Line . As the system tracked westward , it gradually moved into a more favorable environment for tropical cyclogenesis . On January 14 , surface observations indicated that the low @-@ pressure area had developed a closed , low @-@ level circulation center indicative of a tropical cyclone , satellite imagery remained inconclusive . Nonetheless , the JMA classified the pressure area as a tropical depression west of the Marshall Islands at 0600 UTC on January 15 . The JTWC would follow suit by classifying the storm as such at 1800 UTC later that day . At the time , the depression was tracking west @-@ northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the north . Over the next day the system waned in convective activity before resuming its previous track and accelerating . At 0000 UTC on January 17 , the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm intensity , though the storm remained nameless as the JMA continued to classify it as a tropical depression .
 Throughout January 17 the tropical storm would again oscillate in strength , resulting in a brief downgrade by the JTWC to tropical depression intensity . However , an increase in deep convection resulted in its reclassification as a tropical storm at 1800 UTC that day , followed by the JMA upgrading the system to tropical storm intensity at 1200 UTC on January 18 . As such , the storm received the name <unk> . At roughly the same time , the tropical cyclone began to stall east of the Mariana Islands and curve sharply northeastward . Whilst the JTWC indicated that <unk> peaked in strength late on January 18 with 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) , the JMA considered the system to have maintained the same intensity throughout its stint as a tropical storm . Steered by the same nearby subtropical ridge , <unk> would continue to track towards the northeast into a less favorable tropical cyclone environment . The JMA downgraded <unk> to tropical depression at 1200 UTC on January 20 before the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its low @-@ level circulation center decoupled from the primary mass of convection due to strong wind shear . At 0000 UTC , both the JTWC and JMA discontinued the monitoring of <unk> .
