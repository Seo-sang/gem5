 The transmission parameters for a general constant k half @-@ section are given by
 <formula>
 and for a chain of n half @-@ sections
 <formula>
 For the low @-@ pass L @-@ shape section , below the cut @-@ off frequency , the transmission parameters are given by
 <formula>
 That is , the transmission is lossless in the pass @-@ band with only the phase of the signal changing . Above the cut @-@ off frequency , the transmission parameters are :
 <formula>
