 Several agencies issue Dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their precursors . These include the National Hurricane Center 's Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch ( TAFB ) , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Satellite Analysis Branch ( SAB ) , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center at the Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center in Pearl Harbor , Hawaii .
 The National Hurricane Center will often quote Dvorak T @-@ numbers in their tropical cyclone products . The following example is from discussion number 3 of Tropical Depression 24 ( eventually Hurricane Wilma ) of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season :
 <unk> TAFB AND SAB <unk> IN WITH A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> OF T2.5 / 35 KT . <unk> ... <unk> THE <unk> <unk> <unk> OF <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> LIKE THIS ONE WILL LAG <unk> 12 <unk> <unk> THE <unk> <unk> . <unk> ... THE <unk> <unk> HAS <unk> <unk> <unk> TO 30 KT .
 Note that in this case the Dvorak T @-@ number ( in this case T2.5 ) was simply used as a guide but other factors determined how the NHC decided to set the system 's intensity .
 The Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies ( CIMSS ) at the University of Wisconsin – Madison has developed the Objective Dvorak Technique ( <unk> ) . This is a modified version of the Dvorak technique which uses computer algorithms rather than subjective human interpretation to arrive at a CI number . This is generally not implemented for tropical depressions or weak tropical storms . The China Meteorological Agency ( CMA ) is expected to start using the standard 1984 version of Dvorak in the near future . The Indian Meteorological Department ( IMD ) prefers using visible satellite imagery over infrared imagery due to a perceived high bias in estimates derived from infrared imagery during the early morning hours of convective maximum . The Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) uses the infrared version of Dvorak over the visible imagery version . Hong Kong Observatory and JMA continue to utilize Dvorak after tropical cyclone landfall . Various centers hold on to the maximum current intensity for 6 – 12 hours , though this rule is broken when rapid weakening is obvious .
 Citizen science site Cyclone Center uses a modified version of the Dvorak technique to categorize post @-@ 1970 tropical weather .
