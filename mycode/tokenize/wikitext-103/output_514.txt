 On 18 May 1991 , the Zrinski Battalion was established as a special forces unit of the ZNG . The core of the unit consisted of 27 volunteers drawn from the Kumrovec Special Police Unit ( SPU ) . Initially , it relied on former French Foreign Legion troops . The most senior among the former legionnaires was Ante Roso , previously a Sous @-@ Officier ( non @-@ commissioned officer – NCO ) in the 4th Foreign Regiment . In consequence , Roso was tasked with setting up the unit as its initial commander . Major Miljenko Filipović , likewise a former French Foreign Legion member , was assigned the battalions deputy commander . The unit was based in the village of Kumrovec in the region of Hrvatsko Zagorje , on the grounds of the former " Josip Broz Tito " political school . The site , adjacent to the border of Slovenia , was selected to be inaccessible to Yugoslav Air Force raids without violation of Slovene or possibly Austrian airspace . In June 1991 , the Kumrovec SPU was transferred to <unk> Peak north of Zagreb leaving Kumrovec base to the Zrinski Battalion , as well as the second special forces unit , the Frankopan Battalion .
 The Zrinski Battalion was deployed for the first time on 15 June . It was stationed in Vukovar , tasked with preparation of city defences and organisation of volunteer troops . In August , Filipović took over command of the battalion from Roso . The same month , the Zrinski Battalion was deployed to the Banovina , where it pushed the Croatian Serb forces out of the town of Hrvatska Kostajnica . In September , the battalion was deployed to Gospić , where it took part in battle to control Gospić against the JNA . Troops assigned to the battalion captured <unk> barracks in Gospić . During combat in Gospić , 30 troops of the Zrinski Battalion , assisted by Lučko SPU , captured JNA Major General <unk> <unk> , along with three armoured personnel carriers ( APCs ) and 32 soldiers . The unit was deployed to Metković on 28 October , tasked with recapturing Slano from the JNA . After the deployment to Gospić , a part of the unit personnel left to Bosnia and Herzegovina anticipating further conflict there , while the remainder of the unit returned to Kumrovec . The ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska – HV ) on 3 November 1991 . In late 1991 , personnel of the Zrinski Battalion set up another special forces unit of the HV — the Matija <unk> Battalion based in Opatija .
 In 1992 , elements of the Zrinski Battalion took part in the Battle of Kupres , before setting up a training camp in the town of Tomislavgrad . There the battalion personnel assisted in setting up and trained the Croatian Defence Council ( Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO ) . Later that year , elements of the battalion took part in Operation Tiger — aimed at lifting of the Siege of Dubrovnik . In 1993 , elements of the Zrinski Battalion took part in Operation Maslenica , fighting in the area of Škabrnja . The Central Intelligence Agency assessed the Zrinski Battalion as one of the best units of the HV .
