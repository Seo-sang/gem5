 Christopher Gore was born in Boston on September 21 , 1758 , one of many children of Frances and John Gore , a successful merchant and artisan . He was the youngest of their three sons to survive to adulthood . He attended Boston Latin School , and entered Harvard College at the young ( even for the time ) age of thirteen . At the outset of the American Revolutionary War and the Siege of Boston in 1775 , Harvard 's buildings were occupied by the Continental Army , and Gore temporarily continued his studies in Bradford until Harvard could resume operations in Concord . While at Harvard Gore participated in a speaking club , and formed significant lifelong friendships with Rufus King and John Trumbull .
 Gore graduated in 1776 , and promptly enlisted in the Continental artillery regiment of his brother @-@ in @-@ law Thomas Crafts , where he served as a clerk until 1778 . The Gore family was divided by the war : Gore 's father was a Loyalist who left Boston when the British Army evacuated the city in March 1776 . Gore was consequently called upon to support his mother and three sisters , who remained in Boston . In 1779 Gore successfully petitioned the state for the remaining family 's share of his father 's seized assets .
