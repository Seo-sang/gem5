 The production of each colossal head must have been carefully planned , given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available ; it seems likely that only the more powerful Olmec rulers were able to mobilise such resources . The workforce would have included sculptors , labourers , overseers , boatmen , <unk> and other <unk> producing the tools to make and move the monument , in addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers . The seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the production of the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end .
 Archaeological investigation of Olmec basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away both large and small flakes of stone . The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using <unk> , which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself , although this was not always the case . <unk> were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo , indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail . Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in @-@ the @-@ round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work ; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses . Monument 20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche . Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned . It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re @-@ carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed .
 All seventeen of the confirmed heads in the Olmec heartland were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los <unk> mountains of Veracruz . Most were formed from coarse grained dark grey basalt known as Cerro <unk> basalt after a volcano in the range . Investigators have proposed that large Cerro <unk> basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains are the source of the stone for the monuments . These boulders are found in an area affected by large lahars ( volcanic mudslides ) that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes , which suggests that the Olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpting the heads . Roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head . The stone for the San Lorenzo and La Venta heads was transported a considerable distance from the source . The La <unk> head was found on El Vigia hill in the Sierra de los <unk> and the stone from Tres <unk> Colossal Head 1 and <unk> Colossal Head 1 ( also known as Tres <unk> Monuments A and Q ) came from the same hill .
 The boulders were transported over 150 kilometres ( 93 mi ) from the source of the stone . The exact method of transportation of such large masses of rock are unknown , especially since the Olmecs lacked beasts of burden and functional wheels , and they were likely to have used water transport whenever possible . Coastal currents of the Gulf of Mexico and in river estuaries might have made the waterborne transport of monuments weighing 20 tons or more impractical . Two badly damaged Olmec sculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes . A largely destroyed human figure rides upon each block , with their legs hanging over the side . These sculptures may well depict Olmec rulers overseeing the transport of the stone that would be fashioned into their monuments . When transport over land was necessary , the Olmecs are likely to have used causeways , ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads . The regional terrain offers significant obstacles such as swamps and floodplains ; avoiding these would have necessitated crossing undulating hill country . The construction of temporary causeways using the suitable and plentiful floodplain soils would have allowed a direct route across the floodplains to the San Lorenzo Plateau . Earth structures such as mounds , platforms and causeways upon the plateau demonstrate that the Olmec possessed the necessary knowledge and could commit the resources to build large @-@ scale earthworks .
 The flat backs of many of the colossal heads represented the flat bases of the monumental thrones from which they were reworked . Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs , indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments . Alternatively , the backs of many of these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport , providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes . Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments .
