 On the night of 10 – 11 November a Russian column under <unk> 's command began its passage through the narrow canyons , intent on arriving at Dürenstein by noon ; two more columns , under <unk> and Schmitt , moved in wider semicircles , planning to pass through the mountains and attack the French , who were extended along the river bank . According to the plan , in late morning <unk> 's column would emerge from the mountains first and launch a flanking assault on the French right . This flanking attack , combined with <unk> 's frontal assault from Stein , would force the French into a vise ; encircled , they would have no option but to <unk> die . To ensure the success of the plan , the second and third columns , under <unk> and Schmitt , would arrive in early and mid @-@ afternoon and support the earlier assaults . In this way , even if the French tried to retreat west to Marbach , they would not escape the vise @-@ like grip of the Coalition army .
 Mortier accepted the bait of a rumored Russian retreat . In the early morning of 11 November he and Gazan departed from Dürenstein to seize Stein and Krems , presuming the Russians had either abandoned the settlements or left only a small rear @-@ guard behind . As they approached Stein , a column of <unk> 's troops attacked the French forward positions . Thinking this force was the rumored Russian rear guard , Mortier ordered Gen. Gazan to counterattack and push east towards the town of Stein . Fighting spread though the villages of <unk> , <unk> and the farm at <unk> . Instead of withdrawing , as a rear guard would , more and more Russian troops appeared and engaged the French column .
 Initially Gazan made rapid progress , but he quickly recognized that the opposing force was much stronger than the typical rear guard of a retreating army . Realizing he had been duped and that Gazan 's troops were tiring rapidly , Mortier sent orders to Dupont 's division to hurry forward . By mid @-@ morning the French momentum had stalled ; Mortier committed most of his remaining forces to driving <unk> back , leaving a single <unk> 300 <unk> cover his northern flank , and sent the rest to attack the Russian right . Within 30 minutes he achieved the superiority of numbers he sought . His 4 @,@ 500 French opposed 2 @,@ 600 Russians and forced them back toward Stein while pressing an attack along the river . <unk> had no option , for neither <unk> 's nor <unk> 's flanking columns were to be seen .
 At this stage of the battle fighting paused . Mortier and Gazan waited for Dupont 's arrival while Kutuzov and <unk> waited for <unk> 's and <unk> 's . Schmitt 's column was expected to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance . The timing of the respite varies , depending on whose reports are consulted : fighting paused at around 12 : 00 or 14 : 00 . <unk> arrived first and immediately assaulted Gazan 's line with three battalions , pushing the French out of Dürenstein . Caught between two strong forces , Gazan attempted to push his way back through Dürenstein , to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops . Withdrawing through the narrow Danube canyon and fighting off the Russian force at their rear , Gazan and his division were trapped when more of <unk> 's Russians appeared to block their retreat . The narrow defiles hampered the Russians ; <unk> 's men had to march out of the canyons , form ranks and attack in waves . Despite <unk> 's continuous assault in the next two to three hours , Mortier and Gazan pushed the Russians back up the narrow fissure in the hillside . At this point , <unk> 's column appeared behind the French line and joined the battle . The French were outnumbered more than three to one , assaulted in the front by <unk> 's column , in the middle by <unk> 's and in the rear by <unk> .
 Earlier in the morning Dupont had proceeded with his column south and east along the river , from Marbach , according to instructions . Even before the arrival of Mortier 's courier , he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause . They came back to report that a Russian column ( <unk> 's ) was descending from the mountains to take the road to Dürenstein . Realizing this would separate him from the forward division , Dupont hustled his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank . The French assault , heralded by cannon fire , caused <unk> 's troops to turn their attention from Gazan 's beleaguered force to face these new assailants . Although superior in numbers , <unk> 's column had no supporting artillery , and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size . It was <unk> 's turn to face attackers at his front and rear , until the arrival of Schmitt 's column , which had <unk> its way through the mountains in the west .
 Schmitt arrived at dusk , and the action continued well after dark ; in mid @-@ November night falls at close to 17 : 00 in the upper Danube climes . Despite the darkness , Schmitt descended out of the defiles and deployed his troops to assail Dupont 's flank . As his Russians entered the fray , they came between a battalion of French and another of Russians . With the additional force , the French were overwhelmed , but most of the shooting subsided when the combatants could not tell apart friend from foe in the dark . Under the cover of darkness , Mortier used the French flotilla to evacuate his exhausted troops to the south bank . The French and Russians continued to skirmish fitfully into the night as sentries encountered one another in the dark . Portions of Gazan 's force provided any necessary rear guard action , and the following morning the remaining men were evacuated from the north shore of the Danube , while they maintained possession of only Spitz and <unk> on the north bank .
