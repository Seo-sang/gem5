 The Olmec colossal heads are at least seventeen monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders . The heads date from at least before 900 BC and are a distinctive feature of the Olmec civilization of ancient Mesoamerica . All portray mature men with fleshy cheeks , flat noses , and slightly crossed eyes ; their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of Tabasco and Veracruz . The backs of the monuments often are flat . The boulders were brought from the Sierra de los <unk> mountains of Veracruz . Given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their production were transported over large distances , requiring a great deal of human effort and resources , it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individual Olmec rulers . Each of the known examples has a distinctive headdress . The heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major Olmec centres , but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear .
 The discovery of a colossal head at Tres <unk> in the nineteenth century spurred the first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture by Matthew Stirling in 1938 . Seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico . Most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from San Lorenzo <unk> were re @-@ carved from massive stone thrones . An additional monument , at Takalik Abaj in Guatemala , is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head . This is the only known example from outside the Olmec heartland .
 Dating the monuments remains difficult because of the movement of many from their original contexts prior to archaeological investigation . Most have been dated to the Early Preclassic period ( 1500 – 1000 BC ) with some to the Middle Preclassic ( 1000 – 400 BC ) period . The smallest weigh 6 tons , while the largest is variously estimated to weigh 40 to 50 tons , although it was abandoned and left unfinished close to the source of its stone .
