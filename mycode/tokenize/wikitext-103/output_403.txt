 Nero enjoyed driving a one @-@ horse chariot , singing to the lyre and poetry . He even composed songs that were performed by other entertainers throughout the empire . At first , Nero only performed for a private audience .
 In 64 AD . , Nero began singing in public in Neapolis in order to improve his popularity . He also sang at the second quinquennial <unk> in 65 . It was said that Nero craved the attention , but historians also write that Nero was encouraged to sing and perform in public by the Senate , his inner circle and the people . Ancient historians strongly criticize his choice to perform , calling it shameful .
 Nero was persuaded to participate in the Olympic Games of 67 in order to improve relations with Greece and display Roman dominance . As a competitor , Nero raced a ten @-@ horse chariot and nearly died after being thrown from it . He also performed as an actor and a singer . Though Nero faltered in his racing ( in one case , dropping out entirely before the end ) and acting competitions , he won these crowns nevertheless and paraded them when he returned to Rome . The victories are attributed to Nero bribing the judges and his status as emperor .
