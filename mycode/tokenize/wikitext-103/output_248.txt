 The two main approaches to synthesis of N @-@ H , N @-@ alkyl , and N @-@ <unk> are oxidation of <unk> with <unk> ( A ) and amination of carbonyls ( B ) .
 Additionally , oxidation of chiral <unk> and oxidation of <unk> with chiral <unk> may yield <unk> <unk> . Some <unk> have the unique property of <unk> stable nitrogen atoms at room temperature due to an inversion barrier of 24 to 31 kcal / mol . <unk> <unk> where stereochemistry is entirely due to <unk> stable nitrogen are reported .
