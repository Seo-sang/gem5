 The Dvorak technique ( developed between 1969 and 1984 by Vernon Dvorak ) is a widely used system to estimate tropical cyclone intensity ( which includes tropical depression , tropical storm , and hurricane / typhoon / intense tropical cyclone intensities ) based solely on visible and infrared satellite images . Within the Dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones , there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity . The primary patterns used are curved band pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , shear pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , central dense overcast ( CDO ) pattern ( T2.5 @-@ <unk> ) , central cold cover ( CCC ) pattern , banding eye pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , and eye pattern ( <unk> - T8.0 ) .
 Both the central dense overcast and embedded eye pattern use the size of the CDO . The CDO pattern intensities start at T2.5 , equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity ( 40 mph , 65 km / h ) . The shape of the central dense overcast is also considered . The eye pattern utilizes the coldness of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself . The larger the temperature difference is , the stronger the tropical cyclone . Once a pattern is identified , the storm features ( such as length and curvature of banding features ) are further analyzed to arrive at a particular T @-@ number . The CCC pattern indicates little development is occurring , despite the cold cloud tops associated with the quickly evolving feature .
 Several agencies issue Dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their precursors , including the National Hurricane Center 's Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch ( TAFB ) , the NOAA / <unk> Satellite Analysis Branch ( SAB ) , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center at the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command in Pearl Harbor , Hawaii .
