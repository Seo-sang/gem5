 The first text to suggest that Nero ordered the execution of an apostle is a letter by Clement to the Corinthians traditional dated to around 96 A.D. The apocryphal Ascension of Isaiah , a Christian writing from the 2nd century says , " the slayer of his mother , who himself ( even ) this king , will persecute the plant which the Twelve Apostles of the Beloved have planted . Of the Twelve one will be delivered into his hands " was interpreted to mean Nero .
 Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea ( c . 275 â€“ 339 ) was the first to write explicitly that Paul was beheaded in Rome during the reign of Nero . He states that Nero 's persecution led to Peter and Paul 's deaths , but that Nero did not give any specific orders . However , several other accounts going back to the 1st century have Paul surviving his two years in Rome and travelling to Hispania , before facing trial in Rome again prior to his death .
 Peter is first said to have been crucified upside @-@ down in Rome during Nero 's reign ( but not by Nero ) in the apocryphal Acts of Peter ( c . 200 ) . The account ends with Paul still alive and Nero abiding by God 's command not to persecute any more Christians .
 By the 4th century , a number of writers were stating that Nero killed Peter and Paul .
