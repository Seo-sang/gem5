 At 09 : 00 Walker requested the US Air Force to make a maximum effort along the Naktong River from <unk> @-@ dong , just above the US 2nd Division boundary , southward and to a depth of 15 miles ( 24 km ) west of the river . He wanted the Air Force to isolate the battlefield and prevent further North Korean reinforcements and supplies from moving across the river in support of the North Korean spearhead units . The Far East Command requested the US Navy to join in the air effort , and the US Seventh Fleet turned back from its strikes in the Inch 'on @-@ Seoul area and sped southward at full steam toward the southern battle front . Walker came to the US 2nd Division front at 12 : 00 and ordered the division to hold at all costs . He had already ordered ground reinforcements to the Yongsan area .
 During the morning of 1 September , Walker weighed the news coming in from his southern front , wavering in a decision as to which part of the front most needed his Pusan Perimeter reserves . Since midnight the NK I Corps had broken his Pusan Perimeter in two places @-@ the NK 2nd and 9th Divisions in the US 2nd Division sector , and the NK 7th Division and NK 6th Division in the US 25th Division sector , below the junction of the Nam and Naktong Rivers . In the US 2nd Division sector North Korean troops were at the edge of Yongsan , the gateway to the corridor leading 12 miles ( 19 km ) eastward to Miryang and the main Pusan @-@ Mukden railroad and highway .
 Eighth Army had in reserve three understrength infantry regiments and the 2 @-@ battalion British 27th Infantry Brigade which was not yet completely equipped and ready to be placed in line : The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade at Changwon , 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) northeast of Masan , preparing for movement to the port of Pusan ; the US 27th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Division which had arrived at Masan only the night before at 20 : 30 to relieve the 5th Regimental Combat Team , which was then to join the 24th Division in the Taegu area ; and the US 19th Infantry Regiment of the US 24th Infantry Division , then with that division 's headquarters at Kyongsan southeast of Taegu . Walker alerted both the 24th Division headquarters , together with its 19th Regiment , and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to move at a moment 's notice ; the 24th Division either to the 2nd or 25th Division fronts , and the marines to an unannounced destination .
 As the morning passed , General Walker decided that the situation was most critical in the Naktong Bulge area of the US 2nd Division sector . There the North Koreans threatened Miryang and with it the entire Eighth Army position . At 11 : 00 Walker ordered US Marine Corps Brigadier General Edward A. Craig , commanding the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade , to prepare the marines to move at once . The marines made ready to depart for the Naktong Bulge at 13 : 30 .
