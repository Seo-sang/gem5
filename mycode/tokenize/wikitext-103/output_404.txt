 Shortly after Nero 's accession to the throne in 54 , the Roman vassal kingdom of Armenia overthrew their Iberian prince Rhadamistus and he was replaced with the Parthian prince Tiridates . This was seen as a Parthian invasion of Roman territory . There was concern in Rome over how the young Emperor would handle the situation . Nero reacted by immediately sending the military to the region under the command of Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo . The Parthians temporarily relinquished control of Armenia to Rome .
 The peace did not last and full @-@ scale war broke out in 58 . The Parthian king Vologases I refused to remove his brother Tiridates from Armenia . The Parthians began a full @-@ scale invasion of the Armenian kingdom . Commander Corbulo responded and repelled most of the Parthian army that same year . Tiridates retreated and Rome again controlled most of Armenia .
 Nero was acclaimed in public for this initial victory . Tigranes , a Cappadocian noble raised in Rome , was installed by Nero as the new ruler of Armenia . Corbulo was appointed governor of Syria as a reward .
 In 62 , Tigranes invaded the Parthian province of Adiabene . Again , Rome and Parthia were at war and this continued until 63 . Parthia began building up for a strike against the Roman province of Syria . Corbulo tried to convince Nero to continue the war , but Nero opted for a peace deal instead . There was anxiety in Rome about eastern grain supplies and a budget deficit .
 The result was a deal where Tiridates again became the Armenian king , but was crowned in Rome by Emperor Nero . In the future , the king of Armenia was to be a Parthian prince , but his appointment required approval from the Romans . Tiridates was forced to come to Rome and partake in ceremonies meant to display Roman dominance .
 This peace deal of 63 was a considerable victory for Nero politically . Nero became very popular in the eastern provinces of Rome and with the Parthians as well . The peace between Parthia and Rome lasted 50 years until Emperor Trajan of Rome invaded Armenia in 114 .
