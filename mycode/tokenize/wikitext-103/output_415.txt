 The earliest evidence of human life in and around the area of Manila is the nearby <unk> Petroglyphs dated to around 3000 BC . Furthermore , <unk> , a class of <unk> peoples , became the aboriginal inhabitants of the Philippines . They were found across Luzon before the Malayo @-@ Polynesians migrated in and assimilated them .
 The Kingdom of Tondo flourished during the latter half of the Ming Dynasty as a result of direct trade relations with China . Tondo district was maintained as the traditional capital of the empire , with its rulers as sovereign kings and not mere chieftains , and were addressed variously as <unk> ln <unk> or <unk> in Tagalog ( " lords " ) ; <unk> <unk> ( " son of heaven " ) ; or <unk> ( " lord of the palace " ) , the Emperor of China considered the <unk> ( rulers of ancient Manila ) " 王 " ( Kings ) .
 In the 13th century , Manila consisted of a fortified settlement and trading quarter at the shores of the Pasig River , on top of previous older towns . Manila was then settled by the Indianized empire of Majapahit as referenced in the epic eulogy poem Nagarakretagama which inscribed its conquest by Maharaja <unk> <unk> . <unk> " <unk> ् ग ् " which is a historical name for the city of Manila is listed in Canto 14 alongside <unk> , which is now Sulu , and Kalka .
 During the reign of Sultan Bolkiah from 1485 to 1521 , the Bruneian Empire invaded , wanting to take advantage of Tondo 's China trade by attacking its environs and establishing " <unk> <unk> Kota <unk> " ( The Kingdom of <unk> ) . They ruled under and gave yearly tribute to the Sultanate of Brunei as its satellite state . They established a new dynasty under the local leader who accepted Islam and became Rajah <unk> or Tariq Sulayman I. He also established a trading challenge to the already rich House of <unk> Dula in Tondo . Islam was further strengthened by the arrival of Muslim traders from the Arab @-@ Indian area and Southeast Asia . Manila was temporarily besieged by the invasion of Chinese pirate @-@ warlord <unk> ( 1574 ) but was thwarted by the local inhabitants , before it became the seat of the colonial government of Spain .
 On June 24 , 1571 , Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi arrived from New Spain ( now Mexico ) , and then exercised rule of the Spanish city of Manila as a territory of New Spain with the establishment of a city council in what today is the district of Intramuros . López de Legazpi had the local royalty executed or exiled , after the failure of the Tondo Conspiracy ; a plot wherein an alliance between Japanese merchants , Luzon 's Huangs with several Datus and Rajahs plus the Bruneian Empire would band together to execute the Spaniards and their Latin @-@ American mercenaries , and Visayan allies . At the conclusion of which , the victorious Spaniards made Manila the capital of the Spanish East Indies and of the Philippines , which the empire would control for the next three centuries , from 1565 to 1898 .
 Manila then became famous during the Manila @-@ Acapulco Galleon trade which lasted for three centuries and brought goods from Europe , Africa and Latin America across the Pacific Islands to Southeast Asia ( Which was already an entrepot for goods coming from India , Indonesia and China ) and trade also flowed vice versa . Silver that was mined in Mexico and Peru were exchanged for Chinese silk , Indian gems , and the spices of the Southeast Asia , some of which even flowed to Europe . Likewise wines and olives grown from Europe and North Africa were transshipped via Mexico towards Manila .
 Manila was occupied by British forces for twenty months , from 1762 to 1764 , and used as a base for an unsuccessful attempt to conquer the Philippines during the Seven Years ' War . Eventually , the British withdrew from Manila as per agreements in the 1763 Treaty of Paris . The Chinese were punished for supporting the British invasion , and the small fortress @-@ city of Intramuros , mostly populated by Europeans and Mexicans , kept its cannons pointed at Binondo , the world 's oldest Chinatown .
 Mexican Independence in 1821 necessitated direct rule from Spain . Under direct Spanish rule , banking , industry and education flourished more than it had in the previous two centuries . The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated direct trade and communications with Spain .
 The growing wealth and education attracted indigenous , Chinese , Indians , Latinos , and Europeans from the provinces to Manila , all of whom elected a nascent Filipino citizenship regardless of ethnicity . The developments also facilitated the rise of an <unk> class which espoused liberal ideas , the ideological foundations of the Philippine Revolution which sought independence from Spain .
 After the Battle of Manila ( 1898 ) , Spain ceded the surrendered city of Manila to the United States . The First Philippine Republic based at nearby Bulacan fought against the Americans for control of the city of Manila . The Americans defeated the First Philippine Republic and captured president Emilio Aguinaldo who announced allegiance to the United States on April 1 , 1901 .
 Upon drafting a new charter for Manila in June 1901 , the Americans made official what had long been tacit : that the City of Manila was not Intramuros alone but also all its <unk> . The new city charter proclaimed that Manila was composed of eleven municipal districts — presumably Tondo , Binondo , Santa Cruz , <unk> , San Miguel , <unk> , Santa Ana , Paco , Malate , Ermita and Intramuros . In addition to these , the Church recognized five parishes as <unk> — namely , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> , Santa Mesa and <unk> . Later times would add two more : <unk> and San Andres <unk> .
 Under American control , a new civilian oriented Insular Government headed by then Governor @-@ General William Howard Taft invited city planner Daniel Burnham for the transformation of Manila , to adapt the old city to changed times and modern needs . The Burnham Plan included development of the road system , the use of waterways for transportation , and beautification of Manila with the improvement of waterfronts , construction of parks , parkways and various building for various activities .
 The latter included a government center occupying all of Wallace Field , which extends from Luneta to the present Taft Avenue . The Philippine Capitol was to rise at the Taft Avenue end of the field , facing toward the sea , and would form , with the buildings of different government bureaus and departments , a quadrangle , lagoon in the center , and a monument to José Rizal at its Luneta end . Of Burnham 's proposed government center , only three units — the Legislative Building and the building of the Finance and Agricultural departments — were completed when World War II erupted .
 Due to the Japanese occupation of the Philippines , American soldiers were ordered to withdraw from the city and all military installations were removed on December 24 , 1941 . General Douglas MacArthur declared Manila an open city to prevent further death and destruction ; despite this , the Japanese warplanes continued to bomb the city . Manila was occupied by the Japanese forces on January 2 , 1942 .
 Manila was also the site of the bloodiest battle in the Pacific theater during the Second World War . After falling to the Empire of Japan on January 2 , 1942 , it was recaptured by joint American and Filipino troops from February 3 to March 3 , 1945 . Some 100 @,@ 000 civilians were killed in Manila in February 1945 . It was the second most devastated city in the world after Warsaw during the Second World War . At the end of World War II , almost all of the structures in the city , particularly Intramuros , were destroyed but after the war , reconstruction took place .
 In 1948 , President Elpidio Quirino moved the seat of government of the Philippines to Quezon City , a new capital city in the suburbs and fields northeast of Manila , created in 1938 by former President Manuel L. Quezon , which was named after him . The move ended any implementation of the Burnham Plan 's intent for the government centre to be at Luneta .
 With the Visayan @-@ born Arsenio <unk> as its first elected mayor in 1952 ( all mayors were appointed prior to this ) , Manila underwent The Golden Age , once again earning its status as the " Pearl of the Orient " , a moniker it earned before the Second World War . After <unk> 's term in the 1950s , Manila was led by Antonio Villegas for most of the 1960s . Ramon <unk> ( an Indian @-@ Filipino ) was mayor for nearly the entire 1970s until the 1986 People Power Revolution . Mayors <unk> , Villegas , and <unk> are often collectively considered as the " Big Three of Manila " less for their rather long tenures as the city 's chief executive ( continuously for over three decades , from 1952 – 1986 ) , but more for their indelible contribution to the development and progress of the city and their lasting legacy in uplifting the quality of life and welfare of the people of Manila .
 During the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos , the region of the Metro Manila was created as an integrated unit with the enactment of Presidential Decree No. 824 on November 7 , 1975 . The area encompassed four cities and thirteen adjoining towns , as a separate regional unit of government . On the <unk> anniversary of the city 's foundation on June 24 , 1976 , Manila was reinstated by Marcos as the capital of the Philippines for its historical significance as the seat of government since the Spanish Period . Presidential Decree No. 940 states that Manila has always been to the Filipino people and in the eyes of the world , the premier city of the Philippines being the center of trade , commerce , education and culture .
 During the martial law era , Manila became a hot @-@ bed of resistance activity as youth and student demonstrators repeatedly clashed with the police and military which were subservient to the Marcos regime . After decades of resistance , the non @-@ violent People Power Revolution ( predecessor to the peaceful @-@ revolutions that toppled the iron @-@ curtain in Europe ) , ousted the authoritarian Marcos from power .
 In 1992 , Alfredo Lim was elected mayor , the first Chinese @-@ Filipino to hold the office . He was known for his anti @-@ crime crusades . Lim was succeeded by <unk> <unk> , who served as his vice @-@ mayor . <unk> was known for his campaign ( and city slogan ) " <unk> ang <unk> " ( Revive Manila ) , which saw the establishment of several parks and the repair and rehabilitation of the city 's deteriorating facilities . He was the city 's mayor for 3 terms ( 9 years ) before being termed out of office .
 Alfredo Lim once again ran for mayor and defeated <unk> 's son Ali in the 2007 city election and immediately reversed all of <unk> 's projects claiming <unk> 's projects made little contribution to the improvements of the city . The relationship of both parties turned bitter , with the two pitting again during the 2010 city elections in which Lim won against <unk> .
 Lim was sued by councilor Dennis <unk> on 2008 over human rights , charged with graft over the rehabilitation of public schools , and was heavily criticized for his haphazard resolution of the Rizal Park hostage taking incident , one of the deadliest hostage crisis in the Philippines . Later on , Vice Mayor <unk> Moreno and 28 city councilors filed another case against Lim in 2012 , stating that Lim 's statement in a meeting were " life @-@ threatening " to them . On the 2013 elections , former President Joseph Estrada defeated Lim in the mayoral race . During his term , Estrada has paid the city 's over ₱ 5 billion debts , increase revenues by 2 @.@ 35 times from ₱ 6 @.@ 2 billion in 2012 to ₱ 14 @.@ 6 billion by 2016 , spent from 2013 to 2016 an unprecedented ₱ 6 @.@ 76 billion for the city 's infrastructure , built and or renovated seven city public markets , built 22 schools , increased teachers ' incomes , modernized the six city hospitals and bought dialysis machines and magnetic resonance imaging scanners , increased the efficiency of the police force and reduced crime . Manila has become the most competitive city in the Philippines by 2015 , making the city the best place for doing business and for living in .
 Despite his achievements and unprecedented feat as the Mayor of Manila , however , Estrada was re @-@ elected as Manila mayor in the 2016 election against Lim and Amado <unk> , only winning by an infinitesimal 2 @,@ 830 votes .
