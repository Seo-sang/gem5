 The same monsoon trough that spawned Typhoon <unk> also produced an area of convection to the north @-@ northeast of Guam , becoming a tropical depression on October 19 . The system moved northwestward and later turned to the northeast around the subtropical ridge . With low wind shear and favorable outflow , the convection became better organized , and the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Parma on October 21 . After an eye began to form , Parma was upgraded to typhoon status the next day . An approaching trough caused Parma to accelerate northeastward while also increasing outflow . On October 24 , the JMA estimated peak winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) while the JTWC estimated winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , an unusually high intensity for 30 Â° N. Subsequently , Parma rounded the subtropical ridge and began moving to the east @-@ southeast , beginning a nearly week @-@ long loop . The cold front had passed to the north and failed to bring the typhoon northeastward .
 Increasing wind shear weakened the convection , and Parma deteriorated into a severe tropical storm on October 26 . The next day , it began moving westward while passing about 345 km ( 215 mi ) north of Wake Island . A large eye of 110 km ( 70 mi ) in diameter developed , and on October 28 , the JMA re @-@ upgraded Parma to typhoon status . The next day , the typhoon turned to the northeast due to another approaching trough . With decreasing wind shear and warmer waters , Parma re @-@ intensified significantly on October 29 , reaching a secondary peak of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) according to JMA , and 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) according to JTWC . The storm moved very closely along the track it took several days prior . Increasing wind shear on October 30 caused rapid weakening , resulting in the eye dissipating . By the next day , the center was exposed , and Parma became extratropical , later exiting the basin on November 1 . The remnants weakened , later turning to the southeast and dissipating on November 11 southwest of California .
