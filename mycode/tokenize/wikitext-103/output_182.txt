 In 1911 , Pound introduced two other poets to the Eiffel Tower group : his former fianc√©e Hilda Doolittle ( who had started signing her work H.D. ) and her future husband Richard Aldington . These two were interested in exploring Greek poetic models , especially Sappho , an interest that Pound shared . The compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example complemented the proto @-@ Imagist interest in Japanese poetry , and , in 1912 , during a meeting with them in the British Museum tea room , Pound told H.D. and Aldington that they were <unk> and even appended the signature H.D. Imagiste to some poems they were discussing .
 When Harriet Monroe started her Poetry magazine in 1911 , she had asked Pound to act as foreign editor . In October 1912 , he submitted thereto three poems each by H.D. and Aldington under the Imagiste rubric , ( published in the November 1912 second issue thereof ) with a note which described Aldington as ' one of the ' <unk> ' . This note , along with the appendix note ( ' The Complete Works of T. S. Hulme ' ) in Pound 's book ( also published in Autumn 1912 ) entitled Ripostes are considered to be first appearances of the word Imagiste ( later anglicised to ' Imagists ' ) in print .
 Aldington 's poems , <unk> , To a Greek Marble , and Au Vieux Jardin , were in the November issue of Poetry , and H.D. ' s , Hermes of the Ways , Priapus , and Epigram , appeared in the January 1913 issue ; Imagism as a movement was launched . Poetry 's April issue published what came to be seen as " Imagism 's enabling text " , the haiku @-@ like poem of Ezra Pound entitled " In a Station of the Metro " :
 The apparition of these faces in the crowd ;
 Petals on a wet , black bough .
 The March 1913 issue of Poetry contained A Few Don 'ts by an Imagiste and the essay entitled Imagisme both written by Pound , with the latter being attributed to Flint . The latter contained this succinct statement of the group 's position :
 Direct treatment of the " thing " , whether subjective or objective .
 To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation .
 As regarding rhythm : to compose in sequence of the musical phrase , not in sequence of the metronome .
 Pound 's note opened with a definition of an image as " that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time " . Pound goes on to state , " It is better to present one Image in a lifetime than to produce voluminous works " . His list of " don 'ts " reinforced his three statements in " Imagism " , while warning that they should not be considered as dogma but as the " result of long contemplation " . Taken together , these two texts comprised the Imagist programme for a return to what they saw as the best poetic practice of the past . F.S. Flint commented " we have never claimed to have invented the moon . We do not pretend that our ideas are original . "
 The 1916 preface to Some Imagist Poets comments " Imagism does not merely mean the presentation of pictures . Imagism refers to the manner of presentation , not to the subject . "
