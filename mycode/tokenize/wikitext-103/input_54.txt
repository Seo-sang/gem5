 α @-@ <unk> , or <unk> , are an important synthetic motifs present in many natural <unk> α @-@ <unk> have been synthesized in many ways , including reduction of α @-@ <unk> , substitution of a hydroxyl for a leaving group and direct oxidation of an <unk> . <unk> ( pyridine ) - ( <unk> <unk> ) ( <unk> ) and N @-@ <unk> are the most common electrophilic sources of oxygen implemented in this process . One advantage of using N @-@ <unk> is that higher chiral induction is almost invariably observed relative to <unk> and other oxidants . High yield ( 77 @-@ 91 % ) and dr ( 95 : 5 - 99 : 1 ) are reported for α @-@ hydroxylation with the Evans ' chiral auxiliary with N @-@ <unk> as the <unk> . Chiral induction has been demonstrated with many other chiral ketones and ketones with chiral auxiliaries , including <unk> and <unk> .
 Extensive work has been reported on asymmetric hydroxylation of <unk> <unk> with <unk> derivatives , achieving moderate to high enantiomeric excess . The commonly accepted proposed transition state that justifies this <unk> outcome involves an open transition state where the steric bulk of R1 determines the face of approach .
 The selectivity of some <unk> may be drastically improved in some cases with the addition of coordinating groups alpha to the <unk> ring as <unk> 3b and 3c in the table above . In these instances it is proposed that the reaction proceeds through a closed transition state where the metal oxyanion is stabilized by chelation from the sulfate and coordinating groups on the camphor skeleton .
 α @-@ <unk> with <unk> has been widely implemented in total synthesis . It is a key step in both the Holton Taxol total synthesis and the Wender Taxol total synthesis . Additionally , Forsyth implemented the transformation in his synthesis of the C3 @-@ C14 ( Substituted 1 @,@ 7 @-@ <unk> [ 5 @.@ 5 ] <unk> @-@ 3 @-@ ene ) System of <unk> acid .
