 An area of convection formed on May 16 to the southwest of Palau , located within an area of weak wind shear . The next day , the JMA and the JTWC both classified the system as a tropical depression . The convection was disorganized in association with multiple circulation centers , although it gradually organized . Moving westward initially , the depression turned more to the north into an area of increasing wind shear . On May 19 , the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm 03W , and on the same day , PAGASA classified it as Tropical Depression <unk> . Soon after , the convection decreased from the center , and by May 20 , all warning agencies had discontinued advisories .
 On July 9 , PAGASA classified a system as Tropical Depression Falcon , off the west coast of the Philippines . The JMA also briefly initiated advisories before dropping them later on July 9 . Later in the month , PAGASA briefly issued advisories on Tropical Depression <unk> on July 30 off the east coast of Mindanao . The depression dissipated the next day , causing about <unk> million ( PHP , $ 145 @,@ 000 USD ) in damage . The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression north of Luzon on August 18 , with PAGASA naming it <unk> . There were several circulations in the region , with Tropical Storm <unk> to the northeast near Taiwan , and the overall system moved generally westward . PAGASA briefly classified <unk> as a tropical storm on August 19 before ending advisories the next day . The system spread rainfall across China , reaching 82 @.@ 4 mm ( 3 @.@ 24 in ) in Xiamen , <unk> .
 On September 5 , former Hurricane Jimena crossed the International Date Line into the basin . By that time , the circulation was largely exposed from the convection , and the center quickly dissipated . Later in the month , the monsoon trough spawned a disturbance east of the Philippines that PAGASA classified as Tropical Depression <unk> on September 15 . The system moved westward but never intensified , dissipating west of Luzon on September 19 . The broad system also spawned Typhoon Choi @-@ wan .
 In October , the JTWC classified Tropical Depression 18W early in the month off the west coast of Luzon . With weak steering currents , the system moved slowly southwestward before looping to the northwest . On October 10 , the depression dissipated just off the coast of southern China . On October 5 , the JMA monitored a tropical depression southeast of Taiwan that later passed near the island , producing heavy rainfall that peaked at 153 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) in Ilan County . A few days later , the JTWC monitored Tropical Depression 19W , which developed on October 12 after an extratropical storm produced an area of convection . Described as a subtropical low , the depression moved generally northeastward toward Japan due to an approaching cold front . The depression moved through Kyushu and Honshu before dissipating on October 13 . The depression dropped 285 mm ( 11 @.@ 2 in ) of rainfall in K≈çchi , while strong winds associated reached 217 km / h ( 135 mph ) through a storm @-@ produced downburst . The winds knocked over two cranes , killing two people , and left about 9 @,@ 000 homes without power . The depression also killed two people due to drownings . On October 16 , the JMA briefly classified a tropical depression to the east of the Marianas Islands . On October 22 , a tropical depression developed in the South China Sea , classified by PAGASA as Ursula . The system moved eastward and crossed Palawan before dissipating on October 24 . In the Philippines , the depression killed one person and caused minor damage . Also in October , the monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression in the Gulf of Thailand , which moved northwestward and crossed into the Indian Ocean , dropping heavy rainfall in Thailand .
 In mid @-@ November , the JMA briefly tracked a weak tropical depression near Wake Island . The agency also briefly tracked a tropical depression off the coast of Vietnam on December 16 . It finally dissipated on December 17 , with the pressure and winds unknown . The final system of the year was a tropical depression that originated out of the monsoon trough on December 24 east of the Philippines . After initially moving to the west , it turned to the south , and the JTWC estimated the depression intensified into a tropical storm . During this time , PAGASA classified it as Tropical Storm Zigzag . The system made landfall in northeastern Mindanao and dissipated on December 27 , bringing heavy rainfall .
