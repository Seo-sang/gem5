 As <unk> continued to flourish and diversify in the Late Permian ( 260 @.@ 4 - 251 @.@ 0 Mya ) , a major group called <unk> became more dependent on life in the water . The vertebrae became weak , the limbs small , and the skull large and flat , with the eyes facing upwards . During the Triassic period , these animals dominated the freshwater ecosystems , evolving in a range of both small and large forms . During the Early Triassic ( 251 @.@ 0 - 245 @.@ 0 Mya ) one group of successful long @-@ snouted fish @-@ eaters , the <unk> , even adapted to a life in the sea , the only known amphibians to do so with the exception of the modern crab @-@ eating frog . Another group , the <unk> , included medium- and large @-@ sized animals 2 @.@ 3 to 4 m ( 7 @.@ 5 to 13 @.@ 1 ft ) in length , with large and flat skulls that could be over a meter long in the largest forms such as Mastodonsaurus . These animals spent most or all their lives in water as aquatic predators , catching their prey by a sudden opening of the upper jaw and sucking in fish or other small animals .
 In the Carnian stage of the Late Triassic ( 228 @.@ 0 - 216 @.@ 5 Mya ) , <unk> were joined by the superficially very similar <unk> . <unk> are distinguished from <unk> by the positioning of their eye sockets near the front of their skulls . Another group of <unk> , the <unk> , had wide heads with external gills , and adapted to life at the bottom of lakes and rivers . By this time , <unk> had become a common and widespread component of semiaquatic ecosystems . Some <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> , even inhabited Antarctica , which was covered in temperate forests at the time .
 Triassic <unk> were often the dominant semiaquatic animals in their environments . Large assemblages of <unk> with hundreds of individuals preserved together have been found in the southwestern United States . They have often been interpreted as mass death events caused by droughts in floodplain environments . Recent studies show these dense assemblages were instead probably the result of currents accumulating dead individuals in certain areas . These environments seem to have had little diversity , as they were inhabited almost exclusively by <unk> .
 The Triassic @-@ Jurassic extinction event around 199 @.@ 6 Mya led to the extinction of most Mesozoic <unk> . The <unk> survived , as well as a few <unk> and <unk> . While the latter two groups soon became extinct , <unk> persisted and grew to large sizes during the Jurassic . Among <unk> , the <unk> flourished in China and the <unk> became common in Gondwana . The most recent known temnospondyl was the giant <unk> <unk> , known from the Early Cretaceous of Australia . It survived in rift valleys that were too cold in the winter for crocodiles that normally would have competed with them . <unk> was one of the largest of the <unk> , with an estimated weight of 500 kg ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) .
