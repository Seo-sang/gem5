 During World War II , Rajah Charles Vyner Brooke ordered the construction of airstrips in Kuching , Oya , Mukah , Bintulu , and Miri . Construction of the Bintulu airstrip was started in 1934 under the direction of C. W. Bailey , a Works and Building Inspector for the British Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . All the airstrips were completed except for the Bintulu airstrip , where construction was discontinued in October 1938 due to financial reasons . Japanese forces landed in Miri on 16 December 1941 . Sarawak fell into Japanese hands when they conquered Kuching on 24 December 1941 . When the Japanese invaded Sarawak , Charles Vyner Brooke already left for Sydney ( Australia ) before the attack while his officers were captured by the Japanese and interned at the Batu Lintang camp . During the Japanese occupation , the Japanese used the airstrip for military purposes . However , the airstrip was heavily bombed by Allied forces . The British began reconstruction of the airstrip after the war ; during the project many unexploded bombs were unearthed .
 On 5 September 1942 , Japanese Field Marshal Prince Maida ( <unk> ) boarded a plane from Kuching to Labuan to officiate an airport that bears his name . However , he never arrived . One month later , the plane was found to have crashed off the coast of Tanjung Datu , Bintulu . The cause of the plane crash was not known . The Japanese later set up a wooden pole memorial made up of <unk> wood in Bintulu . The wooden pole was later taken back to Japan by the family of Prince Maida .
