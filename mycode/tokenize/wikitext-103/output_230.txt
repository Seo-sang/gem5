 The monsoon trough spawned several tropical disturbances in the middle of August , one of which became Tropical Depression <unk> near the Philippines . On August 18 , an area of convection persisted on the southern side of a circulation , developing into a tropical depression east of Luzon . It moved quickly northward and later to the northwest in an area generally unfavorable for strengthening , such as the presence of wind shear and land interaction . On August 19 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm <unk> to the east of Taiwan . Later that day , the circulation passed just 55 km ( 35 mi ) north of Taipei , although the convection was exposed that time . On August 20 , the JMA assessed <unk> as dissipating in the Taiwan Strait , although the JTWC continued advisories until the storm moved ashore in southeastern China .
 Rainfall in Taiwan reached 69 mm ( 2 @.@ 7 in ) in Ilan County . On the island , the storm left several hundred houses without power due to a lightning strike . On mainland China , rainfall peaked at 101 mm ( 4 @.@ 0 in ) in Wenzhou , Zhejiang , which were largely beneficial in easing drought conditions , while winds gusted to 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) . The storm damaged or destroyed 5 @,@ 880 houses and flooded 1 @,@ 287 ha ( 3 @,@ 180 acres ) of paddy fields , causing Â¥ 38 @.@ 6 million ( CNY , $ 4 @.@ 7 million USD ) in damage .
