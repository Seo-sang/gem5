 In March 68 , Gaius Julius Vindex , the governor of Gallia <unk> , rebelled against Nero 's tax policies . Lucius <unk> Rufus , the governor of Germania Superior , was ordered to put down Vindex 's rebellion . In an attempt to gain support from outside his own province , Vindex called upon Servius Sulpicius Galba , the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis , to join the rebellion and further , to declare himself emperor in opposition to Nero .
 At the Battle of <unk> in May 68 , <unk> ' forces easily defeated those of Vindex and the latter committed suicide . However , after putting down this one rebel , <unk> ' legions attempted to proclaim their own commander as Emperor . <unk> refused to act against Nero , but the discontent of the legions of Germany and the continued opposition of Galba in Spain did not bode well for him .
 While Nero had retained some control of the situation , support for Galba increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy . The prefect of the Praetorian Guard , Gaius <unk> Sabinus , also abandoned his allegiance to the Emperor and came out in support for Galba .
 In response , Nero fled Rome with the intention of going to the port of Ostia and , from there , to take a fleet to one of the still @-@ loyal eastern provinces . According to Suetonius , Nero abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands , responding with a line from Vergil 's Aeneid : " Is it so dreadful a thing then to die ? " Nero then toyed with the idea of fleeing to Parthia , throwing himself upon the mercy of Galba , or to appeal to the people and beg them to pardon him for his past offences " and if he could not soften their hearts , to entreat them at least to allow him the prefecture of Egypt " . Suetonius reports that the text of this speech was later found in Nero 's writing desk , but that he dared not give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the Forum .
 Nero returned to Rome and spent the evening in the palace . After sleeping , he awoke at about midnight to find the palace guard had left . <unk> messages to his friends ' palace chambers for them to come , he received no answers . Upon going to their chambers personally , he found them all abandoned . When he called for a gladiator or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him , no one appeared . He cried , " Have I neither friend nor foe ? " and ran out as if to throw himself into the Tiber .
 Returning , Nero sought for some place where he could hide and collect his thoughts . An imperial freedman , <unk> , offered his villa , located 4 miles outside the city . Travelling in disguise , Nero and four loyal freedmen , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , reached the villa , where Nero ordered them to dig a grave for him .
 At this time , a courier arrived with a report that the Senate had declared Nero a public enemy and that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death and that armed men had been sent to apprehend him for the act to take place in the Forum . The Senate actually was still reluctant and deliberating on the right course of action as Nero was the last member of the Julio @-@ Claudian Family . Indeed , most of the senators had served the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense of loyalty to the deified bloodline , if not to Nero himself . The men actually had the goal of returning Nero back to the Senate , where the Senate hoped to work out a compromise with the rebelling governors that would preserve Nero 's life , so that at least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced .
 Nero , however , did not know this , and at the news brought by the courier , he prepared himself for suicide , pacing up and down muttering " <unk> <unk> <unk> " which translates to English as " What an artist dies in me . " Losing his nerve , he first begged for one of his companions to set an example by first killing himself . At last , the sound of approaching horsemen drove Nero to face the end . However , he still could not bring himself to take his own life but instead he forced his private secretary , <unk> , to perform the task .
 When one of the horsemen entered , upon his seeing Nero all but dead he attempted to stop the bleeding in vain . Nero 's final words were " Too late ! This is fidelity ! " He died on 9 June 68 , the anniversary of the death of Octavia , and was buried in the Mausoleum of the <unk> <unk> , in what is now the Villa Borghese ( <unk> Hill ) area of Rome .
 With his death , the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty ended . The Senate , when news of his death reached Rome , posthumously declared Nero a public enemy to appease the coming Galba ( as the Senate had initially declared Galba as a public enemy ) and proclaimed Galba the new emperor . Chaos would ensue in the year of the Four Emperors .
