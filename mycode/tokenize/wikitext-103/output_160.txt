 Kershaw made his fourth straight opening day start for the Dodgers in 2014 , only the fourth Dodger ever to do so . This season the game was played at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Australia . Before his second start , Kershaw felt some pain in his back and was placed on the disabled list for the first time in his career . He did not rejoin the Dodgers until early May . On June 18 , he pitched a complete game no @-@ hitter against the Colorado Rockies and struck out a career @-@ high 15 batters . The only batter to reach base was due to an error in the top of the seventh inning , costing Kershaw a perfect game . He is the only pitcher in MLB history with 15 strikeouts in a game while allowing no hits and no walks . Kershaw was 6 @-@ 0 with an 0 @.@ 82 ERA in June and was awarded with his third career Pitcher of the Month award . He was selected to the National League squad at the 2014 Major League Baseball All @-@ Star Game , his fourth straight selection . He was the sixth Dodger pitcher , and the first since Fernando Valenzuela to make the All @-@ Star team four years in a row .
 Kershaw had a 41 inning scoreless inning streak that ended in the top of the sixth inning on July 10 when , with two outs , Chase Headley homered to left field at Dodger Stadium . Kershaw 's streak was , at the time , tied for the fifteenth longest scoreless inning streak in MLB history . He won the pitcher of the month award again in July , the third Dodger ( along with Don Sutton and Burt Hooton ) to win it two months in a row . He was 4 – 0 with a 1 @.@ 10 ERA in the month with 48 strikeouts and only 10 walks . He picked up his 200th strikeout of the season on September 2 , the fifth year in a row he had reached that number , trailing only the six seasons in a row for Sandy Koufax among Dodger starters . He also became just the fourth pitcher since 1893 to have at least five 200 @-@ strikeout seasons through an age @-@ 26 season ( Bert <unk> , Walter Johnson and Sam McDowell are the others ) .
 Kershaw finished the season 21 – 3 with a 1 @.@ 77 ERA in 27 starts . He led the National League in numerous categories once again , such as ERA , ERA + , Wins , Win % , WHIP , IP / GS , SO / 9 , <unk> @-@ to @-@ walk ratio , complete games , FIP , and Wins Above Replacement for both pitchers and all NL players . He also finished third in strikeouts despite missing most of the first month of the season . He was the first pitcher in history to win four consecutive ERA titles . Many experts called his 2014 season one of the best pitching seasons in recent memory .
 However , in his first start of the playoffs , in Game 1 of the Division Series against the Cardinals , Kershaw became the first pitcher in history to strike out 10 while allowing eight runs . He had cruised through the first six innings while allowing only two hits ( both solo homers ) and surrendered six runs in the seventh . He did tie Koufax for the only Dodgers pitchers with multiple double digit strikeout games in the playoffs . He was also the first pitcher in history to give up at least seven runs in back @-@ to @-@ back postseason starts ( his previous one was Game 6 of the 2013 National League Championship Series ) . Pitching on short rest in Game 4 , he would again be dominant , but again would take the loss after giving up a 3 @-@ run home run to Matt Adams in the 7th inning . It was the first home run Kershaw had allowed in his career to a left @-@ handed batter off his curveball .
 Kershaw was honored after the season with player of the year awards from both The Sporting News and Baseball America . He won three awards at the Players Choice Awards including Outstanding NL Pitcher , Player of the Year and the Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award . He also won his third ( and second straight ) Warren Spahn Award . On November 12 , he was awarded his third Cy Young Award in four seasons ( a unanimous vote ) . The following day , he was elected as the NL MVP , the first National League pitcher to win the award since Bob Gibson in 1968 and the first Dodgers player to win the award since Kirk Gibson in 1988 .
