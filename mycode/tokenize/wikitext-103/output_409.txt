 The history of Nero 's reign is problematic in that no historical sources survived that were contemporary with Nero . These first histories at one time did exist and were described as biased and fantastical , either overly critical or praising of Nero . The original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events . Nonetheless , these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Nero written by the next generations of historians . A few of the contemporary historians are known by name . Fabius Rusticus , Cluvius Rufus and Pliny the Elder all wrote condemning histories on Nero that are now lost . There were also pro @-@ Nero histories , but it is unknown who wrote them or for what deeds Nero was praised .
 The bulk of what is known of Nero comes from Tacitus , Suetonius and Cassius Dio , who were all of the senatorial class . Tacitus and Suetonius wrote their histories on Nero over fifty years after his death , while Cassius Dio wrote his history over 150 years after Nero 's death . These sources contradict on a number of events in Nero 's life including the death of Claudius , the death of Agrippina , and the Roman fire of 64 , but they are consistent in their condemnation of Nero .
 A handful of other sources also add a limited and varying perspective on Nero . Few surviving sources paint Nero in a favourable light . Some sources , though , portray him as a competent emperor who was popular with the Roman people , especially in the east .
 Cassius Dio
 Cassius Dio ( c . 155 – 229 ) was the son of Cassius <unk> , a Roman senator . He passed the greater part of his life in public service . He was a senator under Commodus and governor of Smyrna after the death of Septimius Severus ; and afterwards suffect consul around 205 , and also proconsul in Africa and Pannonia .
 Books 61 – 63 of Dio 's Roman History describe the reign of Nero . Only fragments of these books remain and what does remain was abridged and altered by John <unk> , an 11th @-@ century monk .
 Dio Chrysostom
 Dio Chrysostom ( c . 40 – 120 ) , a Greek philosopher and historian , wrote the Roman people were very happy with Nero and would have allowed him to rule indefinitely . They longed for his rule once he was gone and embraced imposters when they appeared :
 Indeed the truth about this has not come out even yet ; for so far as the rest of his subjects were concerned , there was nothing to prevent his continuing to be Emperor for all time , seeing that even now everybody wishes he were still alive . And the great majority do believe that he still is , although in a certain sense he has died not once but often along with those who had been firmly convinced that he was still alive .
 Epictetus
 Epictetus ( c . 55 – 135 ) was the slave to Nero 's scribe <unk> . He makes a few passing negative comments on Nero 's character in his work , but makes no remarks on the nature of his rule . He describes Nero as a spoiled , angry and unhappy man .
 Josephus
 The historian Josephus ( c . 37 – 100 ) , while calling Nero a tyrant , was also the first to mention bias against Nero . Of other historians , he said :
 But I omit any further discourse about these affairs ; for there have been a great many who have composed the history of Nero ; some of which have departed from the truth of facts out of favour , as having received benefits from him ; while others , out of hatred to him , and the great ill @-@ will which they bore him , have so <unk> raved against him with their lies , that they justly deserve to be condemned . Nor do I wonder at such as have told lies of Nero , since they have not in their writings preserved the truth of history as to those facts that were earlier than his time , even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred , since those writers lived a long time after them .
 Lucan
 Though more of a poet than historian , <unk> ( c . 39 – 65 ) has one of the kindest accounts of Nero 's rule . He writes of peace and prosperity under Nero in contrast to previous war and strife . Ironically , he was later involved in a conspiracy to overthrow Nero and was executed .
 Philostratus
 Philostratus II " the Athenian " ( c . 172 – 250 ) spoke of Nero in the Life of Apollonius Tyana ( Books 4 – 5 ) . Though he has a generally bad or dim view of Nero , he speaks of others ' positive reception of Nero in the East .
 Pliny the Elder
 The history of Nero by Pliny the Elder ( c . 24 – 79 ) did not survive . Still , there are several references to Nero in Pliny 's Natural Histories . Pliny has one of the worst opinions of Nero and calls him an " enemy of mankind . "
 Plutarch
 Plutarch ( c . 46 – 127 ) mentions Nero indirectly in his account of the Life of Galba and the Life of Otho . Nero is portrayed as a tyrant , but those that replace him are not described as better .
 Seneca the Younger
 It is not surprising that Seneca ( c . 4 BC – 65 ) , Nero 's teacher and advisor , writes very well of Nero .
 Suetonius
 Suetonius ( c . 69 – 130 ) was a member of the equestrian order , and he was the head of the department of the imperial correspondence . While in this position , Suetonius started writing biographies of the emperors , accentuating the anecdotal and sensational aspects .
 Tacitus
 The Annals by Tacitus ( c . 56 – 117 ) is the most detailed and comprehensive history on the rule of Nero , despite being incomplete after the year 66 . Tacitus described the rule of the Julio @-@ Claudian emperors as generally unjust . He also thought that existing writing on them was unbalanced :
 The histories of Tiberius , Caius , Claudius and Nero , while they were in power , were falsified through terror , and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred .
 Tacitus was the son of a procurator , who married into the elite family of Agricola . He entered his political life as a senator after Nero 's death and , by Tacitus ' own admission , owed much to Nero 's rivals . Realising that this bias may be apparent to others , Tacitus protests that his writing is true .
 Girolamo Cardano
 In 1562 Girolamo Cardano published in Basel his <unk> <unk> , which was one of the first historical references of the Modern era to portray Nero in a positive light .
