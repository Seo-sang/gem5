 Although the earliest <unk> were primarily semiaquatic , they had the ability to feed on land . Later , <unk> and <unk> , some well adapted to terrestrial life , also fed on land . Some <unk> became better adapted toward life in water , and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms . The first primarily aquatic feeders were <unk> in the Permian . <unk> and <unk> became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding .
 Most aquatic <unk> have flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their skulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the <unk> <unk> is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . <unk> is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 Â° above horizontal through the flexing of the <unk> @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward . Other <unk> probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . <unk> Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in <unk> . He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus , a much larger temnospondyl than <unk> , was able to make the same movement . Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that <unk> also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these <unk> lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle . <unk> , a close relative of <unk> , also has a <unk> skeleton that muscles may have attached to . <unk> has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth .
 Unlike semiaquatic <unk> , terrestrial <unk> have skulls that are adapted for biting land @-@ living prey . The sutures between the bones of the skull in the <unk> <unk> are able to withstand a high degree of compression . <unk> forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey . Earlier aquatic tetrapods and tetrapod ancestors differ from <unk> like <unk> in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension . This tension would have been experienced during suction feeding underwater . <unk> like <unk> were among the first tetrapods that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting .
