 In one of the earliest phylogenetic analyses of the group , Gardiner ( 1983 ) recognized five characteristics that made Temnospondyli a clade : a bone at the back of the skull , the <unk> , is connected to another bone on the underside of the skull , the pterygoid ; large openings called <unk> vacuities are present between the <unk> ; the stapes ( a bone involved in hearing ) is connected to the <unk> and projects upward ; the <unk> , a bone in the pectoral girdle , is thin ; and part of the vertebra called the <unk> attaches to the neural arch . Additional features were given by Godfrey et al . ( 1987 ) , including the contact between the <unk> and <unk> at the back of the skull , small projections ( uncinate processes ) on the ribs , and a pelvic girdle with each side having a single iliac blade . These shared characteristics are called synapomorphies .
 <unk> are placed as basal tetrapods in phylogenetic analyses , with their exact positioning varying between studies . Depending on the classification of modern amphibians , they are either included in the crown group <unk> or the stem of <unk> . Crown @-@ group tetrapods are descendants of the most recent common ancestor of all living tetrapods and stem tetrapods are forms that are outside the crown group . Modern amphibians have recently been suggested as descendants of <unk> , which would place them within crown <unk> . Below is a cladogram from <unk> et al . ( 2003 ) placing Temnospondyli within crown <unk> :
 Other studies place modern amphibians as the descendants of <unk> and place <unk> in a more basal position within the stem of <unk> . Below is a cladogram from Laurin and Reisz ( 1999 ) placing Temnospondyli outside crown <unk> :
 Most phylogenetic analyses of temnospondyl interrelationships focus on individual families . One of the first broad @-@ scale studies of temnospondyl phylogeny was conducted by paleontologist Andrew Milner in 1990 . A 2007 study made a " <unk> " of all temnospondyl families , combining the family @-@ level trees of previous studies . The following cladogram is modified from <unk> et al . ( 2007 ) :
 1 Temnospondyli , 2 <unk> , 3 <unk> , 4 <unk> , 5 <unk> , 6 <unk> , 7 <unk> , 8 <unk> , 9 <unk> , 10 <unk> , 11 <unk> , 12 <unk> , 13 <unk> , 14 <unk>
 The most basal group of <unk> is the superfamily <unk> . <unk> have several primitive or plesiomorphic features , including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the <unk> that is absent in other <unk> . <unk> include the Late Carboniferous genus <unk> and the family <unk> . <unk> has also been included in <unk> , and is the oldest known temnospondyl family . <unk> <unk> is the oldest species , having been present over 330 million years ago during the <unk> stage of the Early Carboniferous . Recent analyses place <unk> outside <unk> in a more derived position . Other primitive <unk> include <unk> and <unk> . <unk> and <unk> , both described in 2005 from Niger , are also primitive yet come from the Late Permian . They are almost 40 million years younger than other basal <unk> , implying a long ghost lineage of species that are not yet known in the fossil record .
 In 2000 , paleontologists Adam Yates and Anne Warren produced a revised phylogeny of more derived <unk> , naming several new clades . Two major clades were <unk> and <unk> . <unk> includes the <unk> that were once called <unk> and includes two subfamilies , the <unk> and the <unk> . <unk> include small , mostly terrestrial <unk> that may be the ancestors of modern amphibians . <unk> include larger <unk> like <unk> . The second major clade , <unk> , includes most Mesozoic <unk> , as well as some Permian groups . Within <unk> are the superfamily <unk> and the most derived <unk> , the <unk> .
 Yates and Warren also named <unk> , a clade of small aquatic <unk> from the Carboniferous , Permian , and Triassic . They placed <unk> within <unk> , but more recent studies disagree on their position . For example , a 2007 study places them even more basal than <unk> , while a 2008 study keeps them as basal <unk> .
 Within <unk> , Yates and Warren erected two major clades : <unk> and <unk> . <unk> include large semiaquatic <unk> like Mastodonsaurus with flat heads and eyes near the back of the skull . <unk> include a diversity of <unk> , including large marine <unk> , aquatic <unk> , <unk> that survived into the Cretaceous , and <unk> with eyes near the front of their heads . In 2000 , paleontologists Rainer Schoch and Andrew Milner named a third major clade of <unk> , the <unk> . This group included more primitive <unk> that could not be placed in either <unk> or <unk> , and included groups like <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . While <unk> and <unk> are still widely used , <unk> is not often supported as a true clade in recent analyses . <unk> and <unk> are now grouped with <unk> , but <unk> are still considered to be a primitive family of <unk> .
 A new phylogeny of <unk> was offered by paleontologist Rainer Schoch in 2013 . It supported many of the clades that were found by Yates and Warren , but it did not find support for their division of derived <unk> into <unk> and <unk> . <unk> were found to be more closely related to <unk> than to <unk> , which were grouped with <unk> . The clade including <unk> and <unk> was named <unk> . In addition , Schoch named the clade containing all <unk> except <unk> <unk> and reinstated the name <unk> for the clade containing all <unk> except <unk> and <unk> . Below is the cladogram from Schoch 's analysis :
