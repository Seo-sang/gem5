 <unk> and other early tetrapods have rounded otic notches in the back of the skull that project into the cheek region . In life , the otic notch would have been covered by a membrane called the tympanum , which is seen as a disk @-@ like area in living frogs . The tympanum is involved in hearing , and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced tetrapods . It was traditionally thought that the tympanum developed very early in tetrapod evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum of amniotes . Thus , <unk> possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles .
 Frogs and all other living tetrapods have a rod @-@ like bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum — or homologous tympanum — to the inner ear . <unk> also have a stapes , which projects into the otic cavity . The stapes likely evolved from the <unk> of lobe @-@ finned fishes . The positioning of the stapes and the shape of the otic region suggests that the tympani of <unk> and frogs are homologous , but the tympani of these amphibians are no longer considered homologous with the hearing systems of reptiles , birds , and mammals . Therefore , ear structures in <unk> were not ancestral to those of all other tetrapods .
 The ability of the tympanum and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called impedance matching . Early tetrapods like <unk> have thick stapes with poor impedance matching , so it is now thought that they were not used for hearing . Instead , these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch . Early <unk> like <unk> could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground . Later <unk> like <unk> had otic regions adapted to hearing . <unk> has a structure in the inner ear called the <unk> duct , which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing . Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound . The hearing system of <unk> and related <unk> was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians .
