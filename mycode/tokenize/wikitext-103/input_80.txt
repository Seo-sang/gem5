 Du Fu 's poetry has made a profound impact on Japanese literature , especially on the literature from the Muromachi period and on scholars and poets in the Edo period , including Matsuo Bashō , the very greatest of all haiku poets . Even in modern Japanese , the term Saint of Poetry ( <unk> , <unk> ) is mostly synonymous with Du Fu .
 Until the 13th century , the Japanese preferred Bai Juyi above all poets and there were few references to Du Fu , although his influence can be seen in some <unk> ( " Chinese poetry made by Japanese poets " ) anthologies such as Bunka <unk> in the 9th century . The first notable Japanese <unk> of Du Fu 's poetry was <unk> <unk> ( 1278 – 1346 ) , a <unk> Zen patriarch and one of the most prominent authors of the literature of the Five Mountains ; he highly praised Du Fu and made a commentary on some poems of Du Fu from the perspective of a Zen priest in Vol . 11 of <unk> . His student <unk> <unk> composed many <unk> which were clearly stated " influenced by Du Fu " in their prefaces . <unk> 's student <unk> <unk> had close connection with the Court and Ashikaga Shogunate and propagated Du Fu 's poetry in the mundane world ; one day Nijō Yoshimoto , the <unk> regent of the Court and the highest authority of renga poetry , asked <unk> , " Should I learn the poetry of Du Fu and Li Bai ? " <unk> dared to reply , " Yes if you do have enough capability . No if do not . " Since then , there had been many seminars on Du Fu 's poetry both in Zen temples and in the aristocratic society , and as a result his poetry was often cited in Japanese literature in the Muromachi period , e.g. , <unk> , a historical epic in the late 14th century , and some noh plays such as <unk> , Bashō , and Shunkan .
 During the Kan 'ei era of the Edo period ( 1624 – 1643 ) , <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) of the Ming Dynasty 's Collective Commentary on Du Fu 's <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) was imported into Japan , and it gained explosive popularity in Confucian scholars and <unk> ( townspeople ) class . The commentary established Du Fu 's fame as the highest of all poets ; for instance , Hayashi <unk> , a notable Confucian scholar , commented in Vol . 37 of <unk> <unk> that <unk> [ Du Fu ] was the very best poet in history and praised <unk> <unk> 's commentary for its simplicity and readability , while he criticized old commentaries during the Yuan Dynasty were too unfathomable . Matsuo Bashō , the greatest haiku poet , was also strongly influenced by Du Fu ; in Oku no Hosomichi , his masterpiece , he cites the first two lines of A Spring View ( <unk> ) before a haiku as its introduction and also many of his other haiku have similar wording and themes . It is said that when he died in Osaka during a long travel , a copy of Du Fu 's poetry was found with him as one of a few precious items which he was able to carry around .
