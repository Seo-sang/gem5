 NY 93 takes over Akron Road 's name and right @-@ of @-@ way , continuing eastward past a line of scattered homes to reach the sparsely developed hamlet of <unk> . Here , the route turns southward at a junction with Bunker Hill Road ( CR 136 ) . Outside of <unk> , NY 93 heads southeastward across undeveloped areas of Royalton , connecting to Block Church Road ( CR 110 ) as it approaches Tonawanda Creek and the Niagara – Erie county line . The road runs along the northern edge of the creek for about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) prior to curving southward at an intersection with <unk> Road ( CR 122 ) . The turn brings NY 93 across Tonawanda Creek and into the Erie County town of Newstead , where it becomes known as Maple Road and immediately intersects with CR 260 ( <unk> Road ) .
 Continuing southward , NY 93 runs across open , rolling terrain , meeting CR 259 ( Tonawanda Creek Road ) on its way to the hamlet of Swifts Mills . Here , the rural surroundings briefly give way to residential areas as NY 93 intersects with CR 255 ( Swift Mills Road ) in the center of the community . South of Swifts Mills , the road serves only intermittent stretches of homes for 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) , including a cluster of residences around its closely spaced intersections with CR 253 ( Carney Road ) and CR 42 ( Rapids Road ) . It continues on a southward track past the eastern terminus of CR 218 ( Hunts Corner – Akron Road ) to the outskirts of the village of Akron , where the highway turns east onto Lewis Road and soon enters the village limits . NY 93 runs past a line of homes before intersecting Cedar Street , a road maintained by Erie County as CR 261 north of the village .
 The route turns south at Cedar Street , following the residential street into downtown Akron . Here , NY 93 intersects with CR 573 ( John Street ) at a junction that was once the western terminus of NY 267 . At this intersection , NY 93 heads west on John Street for one block before continuing south on Buffalo Street for another block to Main Street . NY 93 turns westward again , following Main Street through the westernmost part of Akron 's central business district prior to curving southwestward at a junction with Mechanic Street . The highway takes on the Mechanic Street name as it crosses over Murder Creek and leaves downtown Akron . Just south of the creek , NY 93 changes names to Buell Street at an intersection with Jackson Street .
 As the route continues southward through the southern part of Akron , it serves mostly residential areas , save for an industrial complex at NY 93 's intersection with CR 163 ( Clarence Center Road ) and CR 167 ( Parkview Drive ) . NY 93 exits Akron a short distance south of the junction , at which point the route heads into another area of open fields while retaining the Buell Street name . It continues on a southward track for about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to a commercialized intersection with NY 5 ( Main Road ) , where Buell Street and NY 93 both come to an end .
