 The La <unk> region was the source of the basalt used for carving all of the colossal heads in the Olmec heartland . The La <unk> colossal head was discovered in 1970 and was the fifteenth to be recorded . It was discovered in a mountain pass in the Sierra de los <unk> , on the north side of El Vigia volcano near to Santiago Tuxtla . The head was largely buried when found ; excavations uncovered a Late Classic ( 600 â€“ 900 AD ) offering associated with the head consisting of a ceramic vessel and a 12 @-@ centimetre ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) long obsidian knife placed pointing northwards towards the head . The offering is believed to have been deposited long after the head was sculpted . The La <unk> head has been moved from its original location to the main plaza at Santiago .
 The La <unk> head is more or less rounded and measures 3 by 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 by 9 @.@ 8 ft ) by 3 @.@ 4 metres ( 11 ft ) high , making it the largest known head . This massive sculpture is estimated to weigh 40 tons . It is stylistically distinct from the other examples , and Beatriz de la Fuente placed it late in the Olmec time frame . The characteristics of the sculpture have led to some investigators suggesting that it represents a deceased person . Norman Hammond argues that the apparent stylistic differences of the monument stem from its unfinished state rather than its late production . The eyes of the monument are closed , the nose is flattened and lacks nostrils and the mouth was not sculpted in a realistic manner . The headdress is in the form of a plain horizontal band .
 The original location of the La <unk> head was not a major archaeological site and it is likely that the head was either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination . Various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished , such as a lack of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base . Rock was not removed from around the earspools as on other heads , and does not narrow towards the base . Large parts of the monument seem to be roughed out without finished detail . The right hand <unk> also appears incomplete ; the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief , probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished . The La <unk> head was almost certainly carved from a raw boulder rather than being sculpted from a throne .
