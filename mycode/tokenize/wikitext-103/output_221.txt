 Midday on May 18 , the JTWC began to monitor an area of persistent disturbed weather associated with a broad low @-@ pressure area southwest of Chuuk . Within highly conductive conditions , the disturbance quickly organized and became classified as a tropical depression at 0000 UTC the following day . In its initial stages , the depression tracked slowly northeastwards . However , a shortwave trough forced a weakness in a nearby ridge , allowing for the storm to take a more streamlined , northward path . At 1200 UTC on May 20 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Chan @-@ hom . Following the system 's naming , Chan @-@ hom temporarily meandered towards the northwest before resuming its northeasterly track . The next day , the storm began to develop an eye ; this was reflected with an upgrade by the JMA to typhoon status at 0600 UTC on May 23 . Gradual intensification followed , and at 1800 UTC that day Chan @-@ hom reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) and a minimum pressure of 940 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 76 inHg ) .
 Following peak intensity , Chan @-@ hom began to intake dry air beginning on May 25 . At roughly the same time , the typhoon began to weaken and accelerate towards the northeast . Conditions continued to worsen as the storm moved further north , and as the cyclone passed east of Minamitorishima , it was downgraded to tropical storm classification . By this time , Chan @-@ hom had lost much of its convection due to wind shear . Early on May 27 , Chan @-@ hom had fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone , and these remnants continued to track towards the northeast . These extratropical remnants dissipated south of the Aleutian Islands the following day . Early in the typhoon 's existence , Chan @-@ hom posed a potential threat to Guam , but remained well east of the island . However , after passing to the northeast , winds from the typhoon fanned volcanic ash from the recently erupting Anatahan volcano towards the island , prompting precautionary measures in Guam . <unk> were reported on the island , forcing the cancellation of several flights . As a tropical storm , Chan @-@ hom caused some damage to homes and crops on Chuuk , mostly due to heavy rains brought forth by the storm . Offshore , a 1 @,@ 040 ton fishing vessel , the <unk> <unk> , sank during the storm . The ship was valued at $ 16 million .
