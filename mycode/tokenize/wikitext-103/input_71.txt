 Experts disagree about the number of species in the genus <unk> ( broadly defined ) . In 1965 , Dutch taxonomist Jan Gerard Wessels Boer estimated that there may be as many as 100 species in the genus . In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas Andrew Henderson and coauthors recognised 29 species in the genus , while Sidney Glassman recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group . Largely following Glassman 's lead , <unk> <unk> and John Dransfield recognised 67 species in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms . An important element of this disagreement is the decision by Glassman to define species more narrowly than Henderson . As a result , what Henderson interpreted as variation within species , Glassman took as differences between morphologically similar species . This problem is complicated by the fact that many of these species are poorly represented in herbarium collections . The large size of the leaves , inflorescences and fruit of many <unk> species makes them difficult to collect . In addition , many important collections , including type specimen , have been lost or destroyed . Sparse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species .
 The three recent treatments ( Henderson and coauthors , Glassman , and <unk> and Dransfield ) recognised a total of 73 species , but only 20 species are accepted by all of them . The remainder account for either nine species or more than 40 . For example , what Andrew Henderson considered a single species , <unk> <unk> , other authors have considered a species complex consisting of four or five species . Glassman doubted the validity of A. <unk> as a species , and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to A. <unk> â€” A. <unk> , A. <unk> , A. <unk> and A. <unk> . <unk> and Dransfield accepted both Glassman 's four species and A. <unk> . However , Jean @-@ Christophe <unk> was of the opinion that A. <unk> , A. <unk> and A. <unk> were all very similar , and thought it likely that they all represented the same species .
 Another species complex in <unk> includes A. speciosa and related species . Henderson ( 1995 ) recognised A. speciosa and A. spectabilis , considering the latter to either be an acaulescent form of A. speciosa or a hybrid between it and A. microcarpa . <unk> and Dransfield accepted A. spectabilis , but Glassman considered it a dubious taxon . <unk> <unk> was recognised as a distinct species by Michael <unk> and coauthors ; Glassman and <unk> and Dransfield concurred , but Henderson considered it part of A. speciosa . Glassman also described a fourth member of this group , A. <unk> , and it is accepted by <unk> and Dransfield .
