 The two heads at Tres <unk> , with the La <unk> head , are stylistically distinct from the other known examples . Beatriz de la Fuente views them as a late regional survival of an older tradition while other scholars argue that they are merely the kind of regional variant to be expected in a frontier settlement . These heads are sculpted with relatively simple headdresses ; they have squat , wide proportions and distinctive facial features . The two Tres <unk> heads are the earliest known stone monuments from the site . The discovery of one of the Tres <unk> heads in the nineteenth century led to the first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture , carried out by Matthew Stirling in 1938 .
 Tres <unk> Monument A ( also known as Tres <unk> Colossal Head 1 ) was the first colossal head to be found , discovered by accident in the middle of the nineteenth century , 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) to the north of the modern village of Tres <unk> . After its discovery it remained half @-@ buried until it was excavated by Matthew Stirling in 1939 . At some point it was moved to the plaza of the modern village , probably in the early 1960s . It has since been moved to the Museo <unk> de Tres <unk> . Monument A stands 1 @.@ 47 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) tall ; it measures 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 45 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) deep , and is estimated to weigh 7 @.@ 8 tons . The head is sculpted with a simple headdress with a wide band that is otherwise unadorned , and wears rectangular ear ornaments that project forwards onto the cheeks . The face is carved with deep creases between the cheeks and the nose and around the mouth ; the forehead is creased into a frown . The upper lip has suffered recent damage , with the left portion flaking away .
 Tres <unk> Monument Q ( also known as the <unk> Head and Tres <unk> Colossal Head 2 ) measures 1 @.@ 45 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 34 metres ( 4 @.@ 4 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 26 metres ( 4 @.@ 1 ft ) deep and weighs 8 @.@ 5 tons . Its exact date of discovery is unknown but is estimated to have been some time in the 1940s , when it was struck by machinery being used to clear vegetation from <unk> hill . Monument Q was the eleventh colossal head to be discovered . It was moved to the plaza of Santiago Tuxtla in 1951 and remains there to this day . Monument Q was first described by Williams and Heizer in an article published in 1965 . The headdress is decorated with a frontal tongue @-@ shaped ornament , and the back of the head is sculpted with seven plaits of hair bound with tassels . A strap descends from each side of the headdress , passing over the ears and to the base of the monument . The face has pronounced creases around the nose , mouth and eyes .
